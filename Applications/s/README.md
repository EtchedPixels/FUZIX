Martin, a guy from one of my hangouts named <c.o.cpm>, located
the sources from this book. The repository starts from these
original sources. Martin also provided the initial CP/M patches
for compiling with HI-TECH C. Then the sources were overworked,
to get it compiled without warnings on old systems with K&R
C compiler, as well as modern systems with ANSI C compiler.

This version of s is known to compile on:

HI-TECH C for the Z80 under CP/M

clang under OSX

clang and gcc under Linux

Mark Williams K&R C compiler under COHERENT
