This is based on the CP/M emulation from Will's UZI for SocZ80

It's been converted to sdasz80/sdld for tool commonality with sdcc and moved
into userspace.

TODO:

-	Fix up directory mapping
-	Use CP/M scratch space for internal variables and buffer pointers
	so we can also support a high loaded version using shared common for
	awkward memory mapped boxes (eg the Memotech) (partly done). We still
	need a one page buffer per process which is still a decent TPA
-	Find a nice way to build a relocatable version rather than one per
	system type.
-	Will need some kind of API for firing up CP/M emulation when it is
	in kernel.


6809 folks might want to look at

http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.hardware.tandy.coco/77846

and see if it could be ported over using our built in vt52 emulation and
syscalls instead of the OS/9 interfaces and if Luis will put a licence on
it.

A faster (but 8080 only alternative) is in the Dunfield CUBIX OS.

6502 folk may have to settle for writing themselves a DOS-65 simulator 8)
