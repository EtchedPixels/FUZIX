		Wish 2.0 - Warren's Interactive Shell
		-------------------------------------

Welcome to Wish, a sort-of-tcsh-like shell based largely on the Clam shell
written by Callum Gibson. The aims of wish are:

	+ to be as small as possible, so as to compile on small
	  systems like Minix
	+ to have some of the interactive features of tcsh, such
	  as command-line editing, tab and ^D expansion, history,
	  aliases etc.
	+ to be portable across as many systems as possible,
	+ to be fast and have minimal impact on the system.

I worked on this shell from 1991 to 1996 and then gave up to finish off
my Ph.D. This release of Wish is an alpha-release, and I doubt I will ever
get back to finishing it off. It is known to run on FreeBSD 4.7, but I have
not tried it on any other system since 1996.

The manual is in nroff form in `Wish.1'. Instructions on how to compile wish
are in the `Installation'. If you are porting wish to another system, read
the file `Ifdefs', `Systems' and the `m_*.h' files.

Anybody who would like to take over development of the shell should email me,
as I can supply some good documentation about the development up to now, and
also a good description of the shell's internals.
