			Installation of Wish 2.0
			------------------------

$Revision: 41.4 $ $Date: 2003/04/21 13:13:32 $

1) Link the most appropriate file from the list of the m_*.h files to machine.h.
   The current machine types are:

	m_386bsd.h		386BSD-0.1
	m_attpyr.h		OSx 5.1a, SysV Universe
	m_aux.h			A/UX 2.01
	m_bsdpyr.h		OSx 5.1a, BSD Universe
	m_coherent.h		Coherent
	m_freebsd1.h		FreeBSD 1.x
	m_freebsd2.h		FreeBSD 2.x
	m_freebsd4.h		FreeBSD 4.x
	m_genbsd.h		Generic 4.x BSD machine
	m_gensysv.h		Generic SysV machine
	m_minix1.5.h		Minix 1.5
	m_minix1.7.h		Minix 1.7
	m_solaris.h		Solaris
	m_sunos3.h		Sun OS 3.x
	m_sunos4.h		Sun OS 4.x
	m_ultrix.h		Ultrix 4.2

   Not all of these have been tested recently, only those described in the
   `Systems' file. If you get any to work, especially with the changes
   required, let me know.

   If there is no m_*.h file for your system, pick one which is close, and
   alter it to work:

	POSIX:		m_sunos4.h or m_386bsd.h
	Old SYSV:	m_gensysv.h
	4.3BSD:		m_genbsd.h

   Put a unique system #define in the file, and try to #ifdef code with this
   define only when absolutely necessary. The file `Ifdefs' has information
   about what defines are available in Wish. Please send me a copy of the new
   machine file when it works.

2) Copy the file Std.Makefile to Makefile. Make sure Makefile is writeable.
   Edit the Makefile to define how to compile the shell. You should define:

	CFLAGS		The compiler flags used when compiling each .c file
	LDFLAGS		The link flags used when linking the program
	CC		The name of your compiler
	DEFINES		Special defines needed during the compilation stage
	CLIB		Any libraries needed during the link stage
	FINAL_TOUCHES	Any final touches needed after the linking

   Suggestions for these defines are given in the Makefile.

3) Run `make' to make the shell.
