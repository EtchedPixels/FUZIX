- Parse assignment to local variables
	auto x = 4; etc
- Write some copt rules to stop the output sucking so much
- Steal the rst tricks done by BDS C
- Output mixed code/data so we can flush the literal pool every line of asm
  and maybe even get rid of the literal pool (2.5K saving)
- Can we split the preprocessor optionally
- Work out what is needed for stack frame based Z80 code

- Clean up optimizier rules now we have ;end
- Flag void v non void to optimizer (elimination of trailing loads)
- How to do tail load elimination but avoid breaking the way it relies
  upon that for returns ? - is the jump $1 reliable for that ? (take care if
  we eliminate the jump $1 for a label)

- Indirection support to multiple output files so we can sort call orders


Macro ops for bytecode form

load r1 (fprel)			; with pre/post inc dec
store r1 (fprel)		; ditto

And ditto with 'and indirect' or bytes (signed and unsigned)

ie so we can generate as a 2 byte op

	load r1 [(2+fp)++]


Z80 registers

BC - providing we tweak the varargs bits (int)
IY - pointer
IX - pointer (maybe)

RST ops ?

- stack indirections
- complex ops (RSTm aa ll  RSTn aa ll hh)
	- pre/post inc load/stores with or without indirection
	- stack shifts
