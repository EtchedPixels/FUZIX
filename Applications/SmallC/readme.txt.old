
There've been quite a few requests for this via net.micro.cpm, so's I
thought I'd post it thru mod.sources.  This is Ron Cain's original Small
C compiler, but highly extended.  Included are code generators for 8080,
6809, 68000, and VAX, as well as run-time support for 8080 CPM, VAX BSD4.1,
and a FLEX 6809 environment.  See the README for a description of Small C's
limitations.
