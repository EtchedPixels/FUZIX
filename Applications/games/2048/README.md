# 2048 Terminal Game

This repo adapts Frost-Phoenix's implementation of the 2048 game for Linux
terminal to run on the VT52 terminal emulation of Fuzix.  By default it will
use the colour extensions.

Changes are:

- Replace screen codes with VT52 equivalents
- Reformat for 24 lines
- Small display option (-s) fits everything in 32x16
- No special graphics characters, just ASCII art boxes
- Empty cells are white
- Accept WASD, HJKL and cursors
- Fix: reverts old score when taking back a move
- Mono option (-m) and help text (-h)

With sundry other compatibility changes.

In addition, only changed tiles are redrawn.  This is hardly necessary under
Linux, but if you were running over a slow serial terminal, you'd really notice
the change.

Tested on the CoCo 3 platform.

Selected excerpts from Frost-Phoenix's original README follow.

## Features

- Classic 2048 gameplay in the terminal.
- Responsive arrow key controls.
- Score tracking.
- Ability to undo one move.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to combine number tiles by moving them in different directions using arrow keys, with the objective of reaching the tile with the value of 2048. When two tiles with the same value collide during a move, they merge into a new tile with the sum of their values. After each move, a new tile (either 2 or 4) will appear in an empty spot on the board. The game continues until there are no empty spots left on the board, and the player can no longer make valid moves, resulting in the game coming to an end.
