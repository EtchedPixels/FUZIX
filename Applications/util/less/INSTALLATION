This is the distribution of "less", a paginator similar to "more" or "pg".
The manual page is in less.l.

INSTALLATION:

1. Move the distributed source to its own directory and 
   unpack it by running "sh" on the distribution file,
   if you have not already done so.

2. If your system is System V:
	cp makefile.sys5 makefile
   If your system is Berkeley 4.2bsd:
	cp makefile.bsd42 makefile
   If your system is Berkeley 4.1bsd:
	cp makefile.bsd41 makefile
   If your system is Xenix 3.0:
	cp makefile.xen makefile
   Otherwise, edit the makefile to make the 
   system parameters match your system.

   These features are selectable at compile time:
	shell escapes (SHELL_ESCAPE)
	editor invocation (EDITOR)
	alternate error message handling (ONLY_RETURN)
   If you want to have any of these features, 
   edit the makefile appropriately.
   (If you do not include either SHELL_ESCAPE or EDITOR,
    you may wish to edit the manual page "less.l" to remove
    the references to the "!" and/or "v" commands.)

3. Type "make" and watch the fun.

4. If the make succeeds, it will generate a program "less"
   in your current directory.  Test the generated program.

5. When satisfied that it works, if you wish to install it
   in a public place, edit the makefile so that INSTALL_LESS
   and INSTALL_MAN are the proper filenames.
   Then type "make install".

If you have any problems building or running "less", 
you may mail to the author via USENET at:
