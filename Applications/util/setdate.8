SETDATE(8)
## NAME
*setdate* - set the system time and date
## SYNOPSIS
*setdate* \[OPTIONS\]
##DESCRIPTION
*Setdate* sets the system time and date either by prompting the user or if
available it can read from the /dev/rtc device and set the time based upon
that.
## OPTIONS
:*-a*
  Set the time from the real time clock if present and never prompt the user

:*-u*
  Prompt for the time from the user even if a real time clock is present

:*-0*
  Assume that times are in UTC not local time.

When the -0 option is not used the time zone is taken from the TZ
environment variable. The time will be computed based upon the specified
local time including daylight savings.
## STANDARDS
This is a Fuzix specific command loosely modelled on the traditional DOS
interface.
## EXIT STATUS
*setdate* returns 0 on success, 1 if it could not set the time as there is
no RTC, 2 if there were insufficient permissions and 127 in
the case of an internal error.
## SEE ALSO
*date*(1), *rtc*(4).
