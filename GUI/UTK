Basic Concept

An abstract GUI built out of windows and within them a tree of widgets for
drawing and rendering.

To keep it simple:
- Assume only the top layer can be drawn on for now
- Don't assume a mouse

Abstraction
- Windows containing widgets, no generic drawing API except within widgets
- Might be text only, or text/colour, or bitmap, or pixmap
- Might be text using graphic characters for corners, system icons etc
- Can be a mix (eg MSX we'd probably do character but use the 768 char mode
  so we can do bitmap if need be), or TRS80 (text/chunky graphics with hires
  card overlay)
- Fonts optional - could be as dumb as a text display or multiple formattable
  fonts and styles
- What to do about scrolling - don't want to assume a readable backing store ?
- Some objects like drawing canvases and bitmaps only exist on some displays

Layout
- Simple gravity
- Packing by hbox/vbox
- Automatically scrollbar windows if they won't fit minimum
- Automatically re-layout on resize

Events
- As far as possible abstract events, menu behaviour and other stuff to keep
  consistency betwen devices
- Some things like pointer tracking and drag/drop simply don't exist in all
  cases
- Sometimes display is locked so we need both timer/poll type events and also
  a way to ask "display locked" for timed stuff

Switching On Small Machines
- Screen to small for multiple-apps, as is memory
- Instead all apps have a way to be run with 'reload' instructions
- All apps keep their state in a struct so they can reload as they were
- Perhaps keep a file state so we can keep an "App" switcher menu that does
  context save, exec context load of other app
- Cheat with "terminal" app maybe - terminal app actually is just exit 0,
  and command to reload whatever as previous UI app to run from command

Widgets - some ideas
- Label (1 line text)
- Button (similar) - on/off, pressable, maybe radio ?
- hbox - packs horizontally
- vbox - packs vertically
- hlist - 1 line texts in columns
- vlist - 1 line text in rows
- table - n x m objects
- Text - multi line text with or without edit (attachable gap buffer option ?)
- SmartText - ditto with some kind of style/formattign
- Progress bar
- File selector
- Icon (with or without text)
- Toolbar (maybe - tricky without bitmaps or on small display)
- Bitmap/Pixmap
- Canvas
- Scrollbar
- Sliders
- Viewport

Dialogue boxes - tbd

Full width windows/max size/normal toggle etc.

Menus
- Outside of the main widget structure, kind of prototyped but need to sort
  their own size, need a way to indicate short cuts etc

Renders
- ASCII		for debug mostly (variants with UDG etc for non direct video
		text mode). Might be a kernel copyrect helper for speed though.
- Text		Simple text displays memory mapped (possibly with UDGs for
		neatness and standard icons)
- Colour	Ditto with colour
- Bitmap	Directly mappable bitmap displays
- TMS9918A	Because it's different (direct I/O), but basically colour with
		some bitmap trickery

Harder are things like indirect displays and also multiple things at once on
a big display. Eg PCW512 probably wants a "real" window display setup

Make ui_init take a want and need flag mask. Makes failing cleaner and also
means we can pick the right mode in some cases (eg MSX if you want bitmaps)



Bitmaps for custom font mode

1	Title bar across
2	Title bar close
3	Title bar max ?
4	VScroll
5	VScroll with
6	HScroll			}	Also progress
7	HScroll with bar	}
8	Resize corner

9	Arrow up		}	Scrollbar niceities
10	Arrow down
11	Arrow left
12	Arrow right

13	Background pattern
14	Cursor for non sprite setups (gets reprogrammed to forms)
		[arrow, text, wait, drag]
15	Checkmark
16	O for checkmark not set

17	Box bar	v		Gives us nice menus and dialogues
18	Box bar	h		Matches tee and corners if available
19	Left edge of window with background (to make window borders work nicely)

21-24	HCDS cards

25	Icon bottom left
26	Icon bottom right
27,28	Folder top
29,31	File top
32,33	Floppy top


34	Box ltee
35	Box rtee
36	Box l/b corner
37	Box r/b corner
38	Box l/t corner
39	Box r/t corner

DEC specials for VT modes

\033(0	selects special font \033(B ascii mode
then 0x60-0x7F are line drawing

71	box across
74	ltee
75	rtee
76	box down
6A 	bottom right
6B	top right
6C	top left
6D	bottom left
61	background
60	check box set

no nice scroll bars but could try using slider style - box across box down
and 6E (the crossing) ?
