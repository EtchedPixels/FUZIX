Fuzix for the Z80 Membership Card

Supported Hardware

Full membership card stack. The front panel is required for the timer, and
the memory/SD card is required for memory and I/O.

Unsupported

Bit bang serial, LED display, front panel keypad

Implementation

This is a fairly classic machine with 32K fixed upper memory and 512K of
switchable lower memory that can replace the initial ROM in this area. The
upper RAM is not a bank of the lower RAM space.

Memory Layout

Kernel
0000-00FF	Interrupt vectors
0100-7FFF	Kernel code only
8000-F4FF	Kernel code and data
F500-FFFF	Kernel common

User
0000-00FF	Interrupt vectors
0100-7DFF	User space
7E00-7FFF	Per process kernel data copy
8000-BFFF	Kernel code and data
C000-FFFF	kernel common

Oddities

The timer runs at 1KHz so has to be handled specially.

Installation

Partition the disk with a modern partition tool (one that starts at sector
2048 or so). Set up a FAT16 partition and a Fuzix (7E) partition as well
as anything else you want. Place all the usual files in the FAT16 partition
so you can boot CP/M, and add the loader.hex file as something like FUZIX.HEX.

Install a Fuzix file system on the Fuzix partition.

Copy the kernel to sectors 3+ of the SD card

Boot the system and hit M for monitor then S for SD, and L to load

Type FUZIX.HEX and it will (slowly) load the kernel off the SD card.

As the SD card is bitbanged the performance is not as good as most other
systems. The 512K RAM helps. The I/O routines have also been optimized and
unrolled to try and get at least reasonable performance. For obvious reasons
swap is not supported.
