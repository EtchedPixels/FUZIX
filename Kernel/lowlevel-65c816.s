;	Unlike Z80 we need to deal with systems that have no overlapping

;
;	Caller is expected to set 65C816 to I8A8
;
;	FIXME: do we want 6502 binaries syscall or to implement a cleaner
;	65c816 brk based syscall ?
;
;
;	Assumptions:
;	No split I/D	: code = data = direct page
;			  This could be fixed by making page track two
;			  values and keep them in ->page.

;	Helper - given the udata bank in A set the DP value correctly. May
;	be worth optimizing one day. Must not corrupt X or Y
;
;	FIXME: there are various pieces of code that break if bank is > 0x80
;	and thus overflows. It might be cleaner if we re-arranged page here
;	and in the bank code as
;			code bank.8	}  For split I/D
;			data bank.8	}  0xFFFF = swapped?
;			dp.16		}  Our direct page (and swap)
;			(if swapped -> swap bank number)
;	that way doexec would do al the work along with bank65c816 and we
;	would be able to do things like sparse bank numbering in the C code
;
;	Even then we can't really make much use of 16MB of RAM because we
;	are worst case 128 processes with split I/D and we just don't have
;	enough bank 0 memory for that many DP and S pages!
;
;	(actually we could lazy swap DP and S up and down memory but really
;	who can use that much space except as a ramdisk ?)
