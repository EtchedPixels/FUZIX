This is an initial 'gee it compiles' work in progress initial 68000 port

Status:
-	Makes a bootable floppy correctly
-	Floppy loads kernel and transfers to it
-	Video seems to work (at least for high resolution)
	(but clear to end of line is not yet done)
-	Keyboard is done
-	Timer interrupt is running
-	Gets us to the point of prompting for a boot device
-	Error trap handling seems to be a bit busted up

In Progress
-	Writing drivers for floppy, ACSI/SCSI, and IDE controllers

TODO
-	Clean up and abstract PSG GPIO interfaces and locking nicely
-	Write the delay loop for the DMA. Probably a good excuse to use
	the Linux 68K bogomips logic
-	Probe for STe and Mega systems
-	FDC set sides etc


Notes:
	Memory below $0800 is supervisor only (traps)

Need to support 'resident' style binaries
Start of disk boot block info ?
