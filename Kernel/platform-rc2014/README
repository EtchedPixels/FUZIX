--- README for RC2014 ---
This is Fuzix for the RC2014

Imported into the current tree from Scott Baker's git tree and adjusted to
build against a current kernel. Don't blame Scott for any bugs!

Modified for RC2014 with FlashROM/Ram board by Scott Baker <smbaker@gmail.com>.

Heavily based on prior work by Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>, 
Sergey Kiselev <skiselev@gmail.com>, and others.

Supported Hardware

  * The Flash ROM / RAM board is required. This board is basically a clone of
    the memory management subsystem of the Zeta V2. It replaces the RC2014's
    default ROM and RAM boards.

  * A serial IO board is required. This can either be an SIO/2 board or a 
    68B50 ACIA board. The 68B50 ACIA is the one that comes standard with the
    RC2014 kit.

  * VFD Display. If config.h:CONFIG_VFD_TERM is defined, then the VFD Terminal
    will be supported. This will display all output to the serial port on the
    VFD. If it's defined and you don't have a VFD, then it probably won't hurt
    anything, other than some useless io to ports 0-3. 

Notes

  * This platform is based heavily on the Zeta V2 platform, so consult the
    Zeta V2 readme for more instructions. This instructions are intentionally
    minimal, focusing on items specific to the RC2014 configuration.

Configuration

  * Make sure to edit config.h and kernel.def to specify whether you are
    using SIO/2 or ACIA. 

  * The Makefile assumes a file system image exists in ../rc2014_root_fs. 
    See the Zeta V2 instructions for building a filesystem.

Things that don't work

  * The RC2014 doesn't come with a clock. I added fakeclock.c, which is a 
    clock that always returns 0. 

  * I couldn't get the WD37C65 floppy to work.

  * Flow control isn't yet enabled for the serial port.
