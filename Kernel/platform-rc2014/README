This is Fuzix for the RC2014

The starting point was Scott Baker's git tree but this has been seen been
rather reworked. 

Modified for RC2014 with FlashROM/Ram board by Scott Baker <smbaker@gmail.com>.

Heavily based on prior work by Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>, 
Sergey Kiselev <skiselev@gmail.com>, and others.

Supported Hardware

	RC2014 Z80 card or compatible

	512K ROM / RAM board. This board is basically a clone of the memory
	management subsystem of the Zeta V2. It replaces the RC2014's
	default ROM and RAM boards.

	A serial IO board. Either an RC2014 SIO/2 board or a later narrow
	decoding 68B50 adapter (eg 'The Missing Module') set to 0xA0, or
	a 16550A serial board or QUART

	A clock source (CTC, QUART or TMS9918A), or an RTC. A true timer
	interrupt source is strongly recommended as the RTC cannot provide
	true timer events and really slows the system down

	Options:

	Z80DMA at 0x04

	ZXKey keyboard interface (boot option "zxkey"). Works with the TMS9918A
	videocard to provide a classic 'keyboard/screen' interface.

	PS/2 keyboard interface. Works with the TMS9918A
	videocard to provide a classic 'keyboard/screen' interface.

	16x50 cards at 0xA0/0xC0-0xF8 (the range is scanned).

	DS1302 RTC at 0x0C/0xC0

	RC2014 CTC at 0x88	(eg SC102)

	QUART at 0xBA

	Z80PIO or SC129 at 0x68 providing SD card bitbang

	SC129 at 0x03 as GPIO

	TMS9918A at 0x98/0x99. Must be jumpered as an interrupt source. For
	version 3 or earlier note the errata and jumper it with a 1N4148
	diode or similar.

	VFD Display. If config.h:CONFIG_VFD_TERM is defined, then the VFD
	Terminal will be supported. This will display all output to the serial
	port on the VFD.

	The RC2014 CF card interface, or compatible at 0x10.

	Floppy Drive Interface

	RC2014 Joystick

	PPIDE (currently you need to change the config.h and rebuilld for this)

Pending
	Sound cards (until Fuzix gets proper audio support)
	PS2 Keyboard/Mouse/Joystick at 0xBB
	Z80 PIO as GPIO
	I2C at 0x6C

Unsupported Hardware

	SC108/SC114/Z80SBC64 or other CPU boards with their own banking instead
	of the 512K ROM/RAM. Please see the relevant port instead.
	SC111 or other Z180 CPU board with linear mapped RAM. See the SC111
	port instead.
	LOROM 128K memory (has its own port)

	SC110 CTC/serial (does not appear to be able to chain CTC pairs, as
	is neeed for IM1 mode). You can run a wire by hand. Can still be used
	for serial baud control.


Things To Note When Modifying

  * Do not move discard below C300 on a 16K banking setup. There is stuff in
    start.c that requires that C000-C2FF space is free for starting init from
    the kernel.

Things that don't work

  * Flow control isn't yet enabled for the serial port.

Stuff To Do

  * Work out how to co-exist better and maybe even modify ROMWBW so we can
    use it

  * Swap (it's there but it's most certainly not debugged or wired up fully)

  * Sound support once we have the core sound layer

  * Go the soft IRQ route with fast SIO serial handling for rx interrupts and
    flip buffers. Also raises space issues as we'll need 256 bytes per SIO
    plus the other costs

  * Support Z180 timer and serial ports fully

  * Use the ROMWBW data to support Z180 timers

  * See if we can merge some similar ports using the ROMWBW machine info ?

Setting It Up

Fuzix on the RC2014 expects a normal PC style compact flash card. Fdisk up the
card leaving the low space free as fdisk tries to do. Place a file system on
it (type 0x7E). Do not at this point place a swap partition on it (0x7F)
although you can certainly reserve on with a different type code.

The loader and attached kernel image needs to be written to blocks 2+.

You can manipulate the filesystem with ucp.

If you are doing this with the emulator then the easiest way is to use makedisk
to create a disk of suitable size and then

	dd if=foo.cf of=foo.raw skip=2
	fdisk foo.raw

	add the file systems etc onto it (either by loopback mounting or
	using dd remembering the start sector given can be used with
		dd bs=512 seek=startsector conv=notrunc ...

	dd if=foo.raw of=foo.cf seek=2 conv=notrunc

When working on a real CF card or the raw file add the bootable image with

	dd if=fuzix.romwbw of=/dev/sdxx seek=2 conv=notrunc

to place the bootable image on sectors 2 and above in the hole the fdisk tool
leaves for a bootable image.

As ucp and fsck.fuzix support offsets in the format path:offset you can access
the first file system with ucp foo.cf:1049600 if it starts at block 2048 of the
CF card as normal.

Then you can run
./rc2014 -b -r 512.rom  -i foo.cf  -s  -w -R -c
