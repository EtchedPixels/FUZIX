Video Genie With EG 64.3 banking option, or the TRS80 'Lubomir Soft Banker'
clone of the EG 64.3.

Note that there appears to have been a different 'EG MBA' memory banking
adapter that only allows mapping of the 64K over the ROM via a different
port. This is not supported.

This port supports the following configurations currently

	Video Genie & Video Genie I/II  / Dick Smith System 80 MkI & MkII /
	PMC-80/81 / TRZ-80 with EG3014/X-4010/X-4020 and EG64

	Options:
		Floppy Disk (somewhat basic support, no format tool yet)
		Lower case mod or built in lower case
		EG3016 printer interface
		EG3020 RS232 interface
		EG3022 S100 adapter (but no specific card drivers)
		Percom compatible double density kit
		HRG1B Graphics Card
		Lowe Electronics LE18 graphics adapter
		Tandy style RTC at 0xB0 (only usable for time locking)
		Anything on the model I list that works with a Genie/System-80
		to TRS80 expansion convertor (*)
		IDE CF at 0x40

	Planned:
		Lowe Electronics FRED
		Tandy compatible double density kit

	Unsupported:
		TRS80 mapped serial/printer port on Video Genie (BUG)
		Genie IIs/III: These are CP/M capable systems with a different
		memory model.
		Any non memory S100 cards that don't match the TRS80/VG
		devices (ie the X-4010 S100 printer card should work)

	TRS80 model I with the Lubomir Soft Banker clone of the EG64

	Options:
		Floppy Disk (somewhat basic support, no format tool yet)
		RS-232-C Interface(26-1145, or compatible)
		Hard Disk (Tandy compatible 26-1132)
		Lower Case Kit (either Tandy 26-1104 or the simple mods)
		Percom Compatible Doubler
		Holmes style speed up board (anything using port 254 bit 0)
		Real Time Clock (supported for time locking, can't do dates as
				 is not Y2K capable, must be at 0xB0)
		HRG1B Graphics Card
		Alpha Products Joystick
		ChromaTRS (as joystick and a graphics device only - need a VDP
			emulation in xtrs to do console support)
		Lo-tech or similar IDE CF at 0x40
		Tandy HRG (user defined graphics 26-9800) [boot opt micro]
		Orcim PCG80 [boot opt pcg80]
		Progamma  Intl. 80 Grafix [boot opt 80gfx]

	Planned:
		Orchestra 80 sound card
		Tandy Model I Double Density Kit (26-1143)
		Support for the FreHD extra features (clock, volume switches)

	Unsupported:
		M1SE/M1RE/FreHD (except as far as compatibility features go)

Generally Not Supported:
	Alpha Supermem and other big bankers (use the trs80m1 port)
	Various 64K only CP/M adapters
	(Unless someone knows one that stacks with the supermem!)

Would Be Nice To Do Better
	80-Grafix		-	need docs, example apps to debug
					an emulator
	TRS80 Model 1 Hires	-	The UK 'hires' actually a font
					adapter also needs emulation support

User Space:
	The TRS80 Model I/III have ROM in the low 16K. The EG 64 allows this
	space to be mapped out and the upper 32K to be bank switched. Because
	the switching is in the upper 32K binaries must be linked at 0x8000
	as with the TRS80 model 1 port. This limit should go away when binaries
	become relocatable

To Do:
	Faster user copiers once it works
	Fast block copy routines for uget/uput
	Hint based pre-fetching uget
	When we have > 512K or so RAM use the rest as a ramdisc
	Orchestra
	M3SE video at least

Memory Map:
	0000-3BFF	Kernel data and boot area
	37C0-3FFF	I/O and ROM
	4000-7FFF	Kernel code
	8000-FFFF	Kernel code and some data/bss areas

	8000-FFFF	User space

	Note that the current build is an over featured one. Turning off
	the  IDE support will shrink it loads.

	Unfortunately right now some core changes are needed to get to the
	point we can have configurable options done properly.

Floppy boot requires a single density disk. The Level II ROM reads
disk 0 side 0 track 0 sector 0 (TRS80 disks are 0 offset sector count)
into 4200-42FF and then does a JP 4200	(stack is around 407D)
