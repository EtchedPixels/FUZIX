Adapted Sonoplex MC68302 board

https://retrobrewcomputers.org/doku.php?id=builderpages:plasmo:spx-mpu

This a system with a 68302@16MHz, 2.25MB of flash (holding a boot ROM and CP/M
68K) as well as a monitor, 1MB of RAM (256K battery backed) a 68692 DUART
providing a console port, an 82C55 PIO and an RTC (not yet handled).

There is a plug in board which provides a CF interface using the 82C55, and
interface points for the second DUART port and minimal SPI.


Memory Map

When are loaded we have the 68302 internal I/O mapped at FFF000 and the
RAM mapped at 0.

000000-0FFFFF		RAM (1MB)
300000-300007		82C55 (odd side)
300000-300020		DUART (68692) (even side)
300040-30005F		RTC72743 (odd side)

Chip Selects

0		Boot Flash 256K (1 wait)
1		RAM, 4MB mapping (0 wait)
2		400000, 1MB 1 wait (flash)
3		500000, 1MB 1 wait (flash)

RAM is aliased in the low 1MB
GIMR is set to vector 80-9F
TMR1 is set to 10ms
The RTC is kicked into 24hr mode
DUART and TMR1 are the interrupt sources

As we boot CP/M 68K from ROM we need to run from CP/M 68K as follows

Binary header
601AH
Size of text.L
Size of data.L
Size of BSS.L
0.L (Sizeof syms)
0.L
0.L (beginning of text segment and start)
0.W (no reloc)
[text][data]

Supervisor mode:

MOVE.W #$3E,D0
TRAP #2

returns in supervisor mode on the CP/M supervisor stack


The serial ports are mapped as follows

tty1	The DB25 serial port
tty2	The port on the CF card
Future:
tty3-5	The SCC ports (these are wired as RS422/485)

TODO

Figure out the right rituals to get the CP/M 68K filesystem working in the
CP/M utils
Write a front end CP/M loader module that has the kernel as data and boots it
Test the console and timer drivers
Test IDE
Write RTC driver
Investigate the SPI state of affairs, see if we can get SD working
Reboot logic

Longer Term

SCC RS485 drivers (serial and/or networking ?)
Ethernet over SPI

How to do swap ?

CF card:

8MB per 'drive'

dpb is 1024 sectors/track
bls 5 (4096)
EXM 1
DSM 2015
DRM 511
track offset 1

As we have 64 x 128K tracks we get 128K to play with so can write a partition
table including a map for CP/M D: and a kernel low, with Fuzix partitions 8MB+
on the drive.
