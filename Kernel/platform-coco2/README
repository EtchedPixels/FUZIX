COCO2
=====

COCO or Dragon 64 with an IDE port and 64K of RAM

Supported hardware:
	IDE (Glenside or compatible)

Memory Map
==========
0000-00FF	Interrupt stack (borrowed as swap stack)
0100-01FF	Vectors and then a few helpers
0200-03FF	Display
0400-7FFF	Code/Data for kernel (take care to keep this below 8000 and
		shuffle stuff if needed to make it fit)
8000-EFFF	User space (28K)
F000-FCFF	More kernel bits
FD00-FEFF	udata
FF00-FFFF	I/O etc


Emulating in XRoar
==================

xroar -default-machine coco2 -cart ide -load-hd0 emu-ide.img  -load bootfuz.bin 
EXEC &H600

See the coco2cart build for a rather saner setup using the cartridge ROM to allow a lot
more features. This is really more of a demonstration of minimal build possibilities than
a useful port.

TODO
====
- We need to fix a tiny bit of user space for this size on 6809. Notably unfortunately 'ls'
