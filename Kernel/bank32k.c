/*
 * Map handling: We have flexible paging. Each map table consists of a set of pages
 * with the last page repeated to fill any holes.
 *
 * 32K paging is actually a bit of a pain. The kernel is 32K + data which means
 * the port will need to play games with the UAREA unless it has some other mapping
 * options
 *
 * We have at least one potential oddball to cater for here later. The Sam Coupe has
 * 32K banking but you can pick blocks to bank high or low on a 16K alignment.
 *
 * If you have a system which has the top 32K fixed and the lower 32K as pages
 * then you have a choice to make. You can use the fixed bank module and limit
 * process sizes to 32K or you can do this
 *
 * - Build the kernel to use a low 32K bank and shove the rest as high up as
 *   you can
 * - On switchin/out do the uarea copies as required already
 * - Use the remaining upper space as a cache for the bits of the top of big
 *   processes and remember the current cached page
 * - In switchin check if the two pages are different, if so check the top
 *   page against the cache and copy out the old cache to its true page, and
 *   then copy in the new one
 * - Provide a bank32_invalidate_cache definition to clear the cached page
 *   when it is freed.
 * - Switch stacks when you switch to and from full kernel mapping to user
 *   mappings as there is no common space for the kernel stacks.
 *
 *   If you are also doing swapping then you need to account for the cache
 *   by providing a swap_flush_cache() method (see swap.c)
 *
