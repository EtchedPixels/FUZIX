Just a mad experiment for now

TODO
- Wrap the loader into something useful like a .tap or snapshot for FATware
- Maybe use ResiDOS for the ZXCF+ loader ?
- Test Loader
- Test Kernel
- tmpbuf and execve(). Not quite as simple as keeping the buffers in the
  execve bank as we also use one right now in fork() and in IDE.

Possible space savers
	tmpbuf2 can go banked (we have ~300 bytes data free so this would
	save us 512 more!)

Fuzix for the 48K Spectrum and clones with DivIDE plus and thus 512K of RAM
that can only be banked in the low 16K, plus video pinned at 0x4000-5AFF.

DivIDE plus

0xE3:	7: conmem 6: mapram 0-5: bank
	(may only be 4 banks)

	7 set ROM at 0000-1FFF and RAM at 2000-3FFF (banked)
	and pins it (overrides 6)
	6 is a one shot and write protects bank 3 and places it at
	0000-1FFF, 
	5-0: are the bank at 2000-3FFF

0x1F	000AAAAX	Normal DivIDE mode AAAA is the 32K bank for the 4x8K
			mapped
	001XXXXX	Enable 128K mode
	01WAAAAA	RAM mode. Disables DivIDE traps and behaviour. Maps
			the given 16K bank (AAAAA) into the low 16K, writable
			if W is set.
	10WAAAAA	As above with ROM mapped (W means flash rewrite is
			possible). We don't bother putting Fuzix in flash
	11XXXXXX	Reset DivIDE plus next ROM access/refresh cycle
			if I = 0-63

We only use the RAM mode. The RAM is divided up into banked chunks and
the 16K chunks hold the kernel plus buffers etc.

We run with the following mapping

0000-007F	Reset stubs in each bank (interrupts etc)
0080-3FFF	Code in each bank
4000-5AFF	Spectrum screen memory and system variables
5B00-7FFF	Kernel data

8000-83FF	Needed to create the exec of init
A000-		_DISCARD area - blown away when we exec init
		(tons of room in this space)

ZXCF/ZXATASP

Bank select is just a different port and different top bit flags, whilst
the IDE lives somewhere else.

0x4278,RWBBBBBB

R = read ROM/writesram if set
W = write allowed
BBBBBB = bank (64 x 16K) max 1MB

IDE is at 
0xRRBF  data/error/sector etc.. as expected 00BF 01BF ...

ZXCF+2 has a fast data buffer at xx9F (for ldir)
31 WO   0 - first interface 1 - second interface (ZXCF+2 only)

We don't specifially support the ZXCF+2 yet.

Bank 0 is used at reset (normally holds ResiDOS) so we leave 0/1 alone.

The IDE is more problematic due to the 16bit port (no inir/otir). We also need
to size the RAM properly because the ZXCF+ and ZXATASP had options from 128K
(not much use - would need reworking of the model to allow secondary disk swap)
512K (just fine), and 1MB (not clear what to do with half of it).

ResiDOS is not actually stunningly useful. We simply can't afford the cost of
extra calls and magic routines and dynamic page numbering with all the bank
flipping we do as we run. We do try and co-exist on disk providing PC partition
table are in use.
