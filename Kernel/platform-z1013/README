Fuzix for the Z1013 with a 32K switchable EPROM.

The OS image is mostly in the ROM and paged in and out as needed. The rest
of it (which must match build) is loaded off the first sectors of the disk
which expects to have a PC style partition table.

Configuration
- 32K switchable EPROM (no option to use 128K RAM modern setup)
- GIDE
- RTC (on the GIDE)
- Keyboard is handled via the monitor to deal with all the variants (you won't
get too far without a fuller keyboard unless someone wants to write an extended
32key driver with a control key setting)

Optional
- RAM floppy at 0x58/0x98
- timer interrupt on the PIO
- timer from the CTC of the K1520 sound card
- 64x32 Poppe video (see also config.h)
- RTC at 0x70 (if not on GIDE)
- SD card bitbang (slow!)

CONFIG_RD_SWAP		set this to swap to ram floppy not GIDE

For the -128K blue the jumpers needed are I believe
	JP8  2-3		Or set it by hand before doing J 8000
	JP11 1-2		D5 pages in EPROM

(the 128K second bank is not currently used so not relevant)

Ideally it uses LBA hard disk and only scans for the first disk. There
is a config option in config.h for JKCemu that deals with the fact it lacks
LBA and has some bugs.

With JKCEmu set
System: Z1013
Model: Z1013.64
Monitorprogramm: A.2 (others should work)
GIDE: enabled
RAM floppies: 0x58-0x5F
ROM-erweiterungen: 32K-ROM, nach RESET eingeblendet
Graphik-erweiterungen: Nothing set
Sonstige Erweiterungen: Echtzeituhr (RTC) (floppy can be set but not supported)

Because of the JKC LBA workarounds your disk must have at least 63 sectors
per track in CHS mode (all modern disks do)

make diskimage
load the generated fuzix.rom as the 32K pageable EPROM
load the diskimage as the GIDE first disk

Boot and in the monitor set the EPROM paged in if needed and then J 8000

TODO: although the memory space left is tight so this may be limited without
      doing a thunked 128K build as well as this one

- Optional external timer interrupt / interruptor on port A.
- Video mode switching (64 x 16 optional 64 x 32 etc)
- Floppies

Note that the system does not have a standard interval timer interrupt so is
somewhat limited by this behaviour.

User mode
0000-00FF		Monitor space
0100-5FFF		Common, kernel data, buffers, etc
6000-EBFF		User space
EC00-EFFF		Video		}
F000-FFFF		Monitor ROM	} or ROM Fuzix code if pageable

Kernel mode
0100-5FFF		Common, kernel data, buffers, etc
8000-EBFF		ROM Fuzix code
EC00-EFFF		Video		}
F000-FFFF		Monitor ROM	} or ROM Fuzix code if pageable

The system runs with single process in memory for obvious reasons

In order to get the best performance the memory is packed so that only code is
in the upper paged ROM space. This ensures any copy to or from user memory
does not need to bank switch in and out repeatedly.

Address 4 bits
	Peter's		128K
7: set for 64x16	Unused
6: set for 4MHz		set for 4MHz
5: alt font		page ROM
4: OS ROM enabled	OS ROM enabled (also enables video)

without OS ROM enabled EC00-FFFF bleed through to ROM or RAM which may be
useful to get a bigger kernel space at the cost of some video bank switching.

The video is kept in CODE2 so that we can safely flip the ROM on and off on
systems that allow it to permit a bigger kernel.
