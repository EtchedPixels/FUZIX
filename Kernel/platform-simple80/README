Experimental port for the Simple80 mainboard plus CF card plus RTC or CTC card

Not yet complete

Cards required:

Simple 80 processor board
Simple 80 CF adapter (RC2014 can probably be used if you modify the code to
		      look at 0x90)
CTC at 0xA0 (to avoid clashes with the above)
RTC at 0xC0

Either SC102 Z80 CTC (recommended) or RC2014 RTC. If you have both you get the
best of both worlds. A standard crystal is assumed. The CTC should also be set
to count timer 2 into timer 3 (jumper ZT2 to CT3)

This is a design that happens to have 128K RAM but the 64K banks are flipped
directly. The boot EEPROM must contain firmware that loads a copier into the
top 256 bytes of both RAM banks.

Memory map

Kernel

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	Kernel (common above 0x8000 for ROM dodging)
F000-F1FF	UDATA
F200-F2FF	Istack
F300-FFFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)

User

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	User space
F000-F1FF	Kernel stack alternative (used during some bank switch ops)
F200-F2FF	Istack alternate (we may take interrupts in either bank)
F300-FFFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)

TODO

Faster interbank copying
Swap only needed blocks for speed up

Emulation

Write the bootloader once to block 0x80
Write kernel images to block 0x01-0x7F
Make it into a disk image

Real Hardware

Add the bootloader to block 0 of a CF card
Partition the CF card with a standard partitioning tool so it has the normal
sector 2048 start for the file systems.
Set up a partition (type 7E) for Fuzix and put a Fuzix root file system on it
using dd or similar raw tools
Set up a second partition (type 7F) as swap.

You can partition the rest of the card however you want.

Boot the machine and in the monitor run the CPM command.
