Fuzix for the RC2014 system with 6809 processor card

(This is an initial sketch for the port, it does not yet work)

This uses the standard RC2014 cards and mappings. The 6809 card maps the I/O
space on the bus to MMIO $FExx on the 6809 CPU.

The standard 512K RAM card is used with 4x16K bank control. The I/O window
has priority over the memory banking.

For now we use simple banking not 16K paging, this wants fixing once we are
up and running. The map however is arranged roughly as it should end up

Memory map:

User mode
0000-BCFF:		User process
BD00-BEFF:		udata stash
C000-FBFF:		common/kernel
FC00-FDFF:		udata
FE00-FEFF:		I/O
FF00-FFFF:		vectors etc

Kernel mode
0000-FBFF:		common/kernel
FC00-FDFF:		udata
FE00-FEFF:		I/O
FF00-FFFF:		vectors etc

Devices

IDE at 0xFE10
6522 VIA at 0xFE60
16x50 UART at 0xFEC0

(It would be nice to support 68xx peripherals too but that needs a suitable
 card designing with an ACIA and PIA)


TODO:

Rework the boot ROM bootstrap checks before starting CUBIX from ROM
Bootstrap loader
Align crt0 and bootstrap
Ensure constants end up 0xC000 and higher (.link)
Timer/VIA set up
Move istack to FF00-FF??
