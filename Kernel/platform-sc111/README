This is Fuzix for the SC111 Z180 RC2014 system with a suitable linear RAM/ROM
module (RAM is expected to fill the upper 512K)

Based upon the N8VEM Mark IV port by Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

Cards required:
SC111 or similar Z180 CPU interface
SC119 or similar (ROM in low 512K RAM in high 512K) unbanked memory
RC2014 CF IDE

Currently SCM is supported. Once there is a ROMWBW then support will be added
to boot that way too.

Supported hardware:
 - RC2014 CF IDE interface

Untested
 - SD card on CSIO port

Not yet supported but planned:
 - RC2014 serial/ctc interfaces (only the onboard ports are handled)
 - RC2014 RTC
 - RC2014 TMS9918A
 - Swap

Experiments pending
 - Using the clock doubler and some wait stating

To set up

Write the bootloader to blocks 0-23 of the CF adapter
Write the kernel to blocks 24+
Partition with a vaguely modern fdisk (2048 block offset base, not 63)
Add partition for filesystem
Copy filesystem onto partition

In SCM type 'CPM' and instead of CP/M it will boot Fuzix. You can also in
theory run the binary from CP/M but it may be too big to fit.

The root filesystem device can be specified as either a decimal number, or as a
a device name (without the /dev prefix); hda, hdb, hda1, hda2, etc.

When booting the system from CP/M you can specify the root filesystem device on
the command line after the command name or unit number.

For example, with root filesystem on /dev/hdb1 (minor #17) at the CP/M command
prompt:

    A> FUZIX hdb1
or  A> FUZIX 17
