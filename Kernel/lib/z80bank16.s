; Based on code 2013-12-21 William R Sowerbutts

;
;	This is intended to provide generic support for most 16K multibank
;	platforms.
;
;	The platform should define
;	TOP_PORT		the I/O port that the top page byte is
;				written into
;
;	top_bank must resolve to the byte used to store the top bank value
;	in memory
;
;	If the platform needs to maniuplate the page byte values then this
;	code will need to be copied and tweaked, for now anyway.
;
;	fork_copy remains platform specific.
