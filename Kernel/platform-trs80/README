TRS80 Model 4/4P
(or right now more accurately sdltrs/xtrs)

Emulator Bugs:
	The emulator is horribly insecure, it's default is to allow all
	sorts of direct access to things. Even if you turn this off I've
	had it segfault with FUZIX bugs which suggests its not too secure.

	Repeating instructions like LDIR appear to be misemulated. LDIR
	is performed an emulated block copy, not as an iterated LDI. The
	real processor actually implements LDIR as  "LDI, if not done
	PC -= 2". FUZIX doesn't do any overlapped LDIR tricks so shouldn't
	be affected.

	The interrupt flags are misemulated. A patch for this is in the
	Fuzix tree and is needed to run Fuzix on xtrs/sdltrs

Requirements: 
	128K RAM fitted
	Hard disk drive (will be used for swap), or a suitable memory
	expander board could be used with a bit of tweaking (or both!)
	(The hard disk code should work with the Lo-tech IDE adapter but
	this has yet to be confirmed)

Memory Map:
	Base memory 0-FFFF (with a fair bit of slack) is used for the kernel
	User processes run 0-7FFF in bank U64L32 or U64U32, in both cases
	with the upper 32K being kept as the kernel bank.

	It would be good to support 64K processes using the bank32 model.
	Before that can be done however the TRS80 will need a custom
	user copy function to deal with access to the upper 32K by mapping
	it low instead. It will also need the location of the uarea stash to
	be binary size dependent. Swapper write out is also fairly hairy
	for the same reasons. So for now we just handle a pair of 32K
	processes.

	Processes that don't fit are swapped to hard disk. Without swap you
	can run a pair of 32K processes, just enough for stuff like
	bootstrap.

Drivers:
	80 column display is done
	Keyboard is done
	Floppy and Hard disk are done and minimally tested
	Floppy drivers do not yet deal with double sided disks or sd/dd
	media detection
	Hard disk reads block 0, and handle partitions of some form
	including finding where 'swap' lives

Adding Support For Other Banked RAM:
	See trs80.s, and the various map_* functions. These can be extended
	to use U_DATA__U_PAGE+1 to carry a second byte of data. The
	main.c for the platform sets up the pagemaps as a 16bit value
	which currently is just the opreg bits for the two banks.

	map_save/restore will also need to handle any sub banking
	arrangement.

	Finally up MAX_BANKS in platform/config.h accordingly.


Setting It Up (current xtrs: https://github.com/TimothyPMann/xtrs)

	This needs patches currently in progress

	# Tool to make disk images
	make tools/makejv3
	# Double density single sided 40 track boot disk
	tools/makejv3 dd40s /dev/zero disk4p-0
	# Build kernel and boot block (edit Makefile, set target then)
	make
	# Add pieces to the disk (boot block in sector 0, kernel at end)
	dd if=zout/trs80load.cim of=disk4p-0 bs=1 seek=8960 conv=notrunc
	dd if=fuzix.bin of=disk4p-0 bs=1 seek=142336 conv=notrunc
	# Once we get that far you can also put a filesystem in the lower
	# blocks
	#
	xtrs -model 4p -emtsafe

To set up for hard disk, create a hard disk with the xtrs tools and

	mkdisk -h hard4p-0
	# This assumes the default disk size
	cd Standalone/filesystem-src
	./build-filesystem trs80.hd 256 21760
	dd if=trs80.hd of=hard4p-0 bs=256 seek=1 conv=notrunc
	tools/trslabel hard4p-0
	#
	xtrs -model 4p -emtsafe


Setting It Up (patched SDLTRS)

	# Tool to make disk images
	make tools/makejv3
	# Double density single sided 40 track boot disk
	tools/makejv3 dd40s /dev/zero mydisk.jv3
	# Build kernel and boot block (edit Makefile, set target then)
	make
	# Add pieces to the disk (boot block in sector 0, kernel at end)
	dd if=zout/trs80load.cim of=mydisk.jv3 bs=1 seek=8960 conv=notrunc
	dd if=fuzix.bin of=mydisk.jv3 bs=1 seek=142336 conv=notrunc
	# Once we get that far you can also put a filesystem in the lower
	# blocks
	#
	sdltrs -model 4p -emtsafe -disk0 mydisk.jv3
	#
	# and remember to mark the fd volume as writeable

To set up for hard disk, create a hard disk with the xtrs tools and

	mkdisk -h hard4-0
	# This assumes the default disk size
	cd Standalone/filesystem-src
	./build-filesystem trs80.hd 256 21760
	dd if=trs80.hd of=hard4-0 bs=256 seek=1 conv=notrunc
	tools/trslabel hard4-0
	#
	sdltrs -model 4p -emtsafe -disk0 mydisk.jv3 -hard0 hard4-0



You will still need a boot floppy at this point but just boot with device
0 (or hit return). Swap is configured to be on the end of the hard disk



Banking Models

Currently Supported:
	TRS80 model 4 with inbuilt memory bank switching

In Progress:
	Port 0x94 modification to add extra internal RAM to a 4 and 4P

Not Yet Started:
	"Selector" for Model 1. Port 31 allows memory reshuffling away from
the model 1 default. Either the upper or lower 32K is switchable but not
both at once. bits 4/5 control the selection between a further 4 32K banks.
Also needs model 1 support adding of course.


Documentation Needed:
	Various other RAM banking boards (AlphaTech and the like)

	HD64180 mods with more RAM (these are I suspect almost a different port)
	(XLR8R etc)

Not Usable:
	Various model 1 interfaces that provide 64K RAM or near 64K RAM. Not
enough for Fuzix on Z80. Possibly enough for UZI with a hard disc.

	LNW80 model II (same problem - 64K only)
