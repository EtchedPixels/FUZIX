Pentagon 1024 (except very early ones)

Pentagon 1MB uses EFF7 bit 3 to turn on the RAM mapping

EFF7
2:	set for 128K compatibility (bit 5 is paging lock etc)
3:	set to map RAM bank 0 over low 16K

The usual 7FFD register is the banking except that the bits are not quite matching
the 128K spectrum

0:	bit 0 of bank
1:	bit 1 of bank
2:	bit 2 of bank
3:	video RAM bank select
4:	ROM select (editor or basic)
5:	bit 5 of bank		(disable paging on 128K spectrum)
6:	bit 3 of bank		(unused on 128K spectrum)
7:	bit 4 of bank		(unused on 128K spectrum)

As we never care about bank order we just treat 5/3/4 as if they were 3/4/5.
Only 000 is special and it's the same in either order.



These machines all have the same basic problem, there is a 16K window at
C000-FFFF which is pageable but no bigger pageable range.

We run with the following mapping

0000-3FFF	IRQ vectors, common, const, commondata etc
4000-5FFF	Spectrum screen memory and system variables
6000-7FFF	Free for now
8000-83FF	Needed to create the exec of init
8400-BFFF	_DISCARD area - blown away when we exec init
		(tons of room in this space)
C000-FFFF
	0:	0000-3FFF (Kernel data/common)
	1:	Kernel CODE (fairly full)
	2:	Mapped at 0x8000-0xBFFF (holds current process copy)
	3:	User process
	4:	User process
	5:	Mapped at 0x4000-0x7FFF (Screen, spare)
	6:	Kernel CODE2 (fairly full)
	7:	CODE3, Video (lots of room)

User processes live in 3/4 and 8+. We have to copy stuff back and forth
to page 2 due to the memory manager limits.

To Do:
-	Floppy driver
-	Optimizations for switching (runticks expiry on non-preempt case
	should we clear runticks - pro it gets us better perf, anti it reduces
	responsiveness.
-	Parent first support
-	See if we can in fact keep 6000-7FFF clear. If so we can look at
	ldir switching another 8K up and down to give 40K program sizes
	which would be a big improvement. Would need us to allocate 2.5
	banks per process however so need some allocator changes
-	Need a nice way to support multiple IDE controllers in one system
-	Loader variant to support Pentagon 512 with DivIDE/DivMMC - at least
	altram systems.

General ZX issues
-	Why does ls /bin lose the lowest pixel row of the 'yes' command ?
	(Seems we lose the bottom line of the left most char - off by one bug
	 in zxvid ?)
-	6 or 5bit wide fonts (42, 51 column)
-	Optimize zxvid - especially scrolling
-	Move vtborder to common

Floppy disk interfaces are problematic. The standard Betadisk interface locks
the I/O ports to its ROM being active, which sucks. Fortunately it appears
there is a mildy insane stunt we can pull. We can use the ROM to query itself
to find the address of the out (c),a present in all Beta ROM images.

We can then do a ROP attack on the ROM in order to make it do the "right"
out (c),a  in it in order to do a bank switch with RAM at 0000-3FFF and catch
the next instruction. Providing we remain in the RAM below 4000 it'll leave
the card selected.

Does mean we need to patch our kernel to grab the next instruction, and then
put it back all under di but it does look doable.
