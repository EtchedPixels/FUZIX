# Amstrad CPC6128


## Mmeory Model

The CPC6128 supported memory maps:

 -MAP-	     C0     C1     C2     C3     C4     C5     C6     C7
 0000-3FFF   RAM_0  RAM_0  RAM_4  RAM_0  RAM_0  RAM_0  RAM_0  RAM_0
 4000-7FFF   RAM_1  RAM_1  RAM_5  RAM_3  RAM_4  RAM_5  RAM_6  RAM_7
 8000-BFFF   RAM_2  RAM_2  RAM_6  RAM_2  RAM_2  RAM_2  RAM_2  RAM_2
 C000-FFFF   RAM_3  RAM_7  RAM_7  RAM_7  RAM_3  RAM_3  RAM_3  RAM_3

This port is based on the zx+3 port, following Alan Cox's suggestion to take advantage of the fact that memory maps C1, C2 and C3 correspond to the maps used in the zx+3 port.

In the zx+3:
| User		| 0 / 1 / 2  | Common 3
| Kernel	| 4 / 5 / 6  | Common 3
| Video		| 4 / 7 / 6  | Common 3

In the CPC6128:
| User		| 4 / 5 / 6  | Common 7 (map C2)
| Kernel	| 0 / 1 / 2  | Common 7 (map C1)
| Video		| 0 / 3 / 2  | Common 7 (map C3)



## STATUS

Video mode 2 is used. The video driver configures the CRTC in 64x32 characters to do easy hardware scroll and use the whole video memory bank.

The floppy driver seems to work. /dev/fd0 is drive A and /dev/fd1 is drive B. fd0 is hard coded to one side and fd1 to double side. A minimal system root disk image is generated to boot from fd1. Format is 9 sectors per track with sector ID from 1 to 9.

The IDE driver that is supposed to work with the symbiface and xmass fails to initialize. FIXED, tested with ACE-DL emulator x-mass suport.

The USB mass storage of the Albiero works using the ch375 driver used in other platforms. It should be easy to get it working with the Usifac/Ulifac.

There isn't a proper loader, for now a snapshot is generated. FIXED, dsk floppy boot image generated.

To test it burn disk.img on a spare usb pendrive and put it on the albireo. Load an run the snapshot or burn the dsk in a floppy and start FUZIX with |cpm.


## TODO

Fix fdc driver. DONE
Fix IDE driver. DONE
Sometimes the top byte of the characters isn't drawn. FIXED
Vertical scroll shows the bottom line of the screen in the top of the screen. FIXED
Fix memory size reporting 64 v 48K (inherited from zx+3).
do_beep() doesn't seem to work. FIXED
Write a proper loader. DONE.
Configurable screen, at least add 80x25, maybe also change the video mode and routines to manage 6x8 fonts.
Support more hardware: M4 Board (storage, network and RTC), Ulifac/Usifac, networking with wifi module plugged in the usifac, sdcard in the Albireo, try slip with the serial port of the usifac...

Fix lots of bugs.

Switch to a thunked memory model based on C2 Map to use the standard and extended RAM expansions up to 4MiB, the Cromemco port could be a model to this solution. As ther is no real common as we are switching the whole 64k space, the common data area has to be updated in all the used banks, but this can give aprox. 60K for kernel and user and hold a lot of processes in memory with a big RAM expansion. If this proves to be too hard, a RAM disk for swapping can be a way to use the RAM expansions.

Look for speed optimization opportunities.

## BUILD & RUN

make diskimage with cpc6128 target in base Makefile
.sna snapshot, .dsk Floppy image, and mass storage filesystem images are generated in Images folder. Tu boot from floppy use |cpm command from basic prompt

To run on emulator use ACE-DL emulator and use disk.img as image for the x-mass IDE interface emulation.
