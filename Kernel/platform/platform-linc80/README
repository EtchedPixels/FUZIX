LiNC80 Experimental Port

This port supports the following configurations

	LiNC80 with at least one extra 16K bank of RAM as bank 1
	(additional banks will not be used at this point)

	IDE CF card with Fuzix loader, Fuzix and both a root fs and a
	swap partition.

	Optional SD card on Z80 PIO

	Options:
		No LiNC80 or RC2014 add in cards are currently supported

	Planned:
		A different build that supports multiple banks of 16K or
		with a simple board mod 32K banks
		Maybe sound card when we get to the Fuzix sound support

TO DO

Version that supports multiple 16K banks and multiple processes in memory
ZX style. Also code to probe for and use the 32K hack which is far nicer.

Use IM2 properly and do serial buffering code

Check for flow controlling in writeready

In progress serial

TODO:

Why does reboot muck up SD card ?? emulator bug ?

Core code IM2 enabling

- Add a DI and EI macro
- Use them in cases where we don't need to really disable interrupts (because
  the stack is valid), use di/ei and __hard_() methods for the other cases
- With an IM2 platform enable real interrupts in interrupt_handler at the
  first point we can, and for interrupt_handler do an inc and defer for the
  next tick if we can't re-enter (so we don't lose ticks and we don't miss
  latencies)
