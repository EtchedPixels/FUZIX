Aquarius+ Initial Prototyping

4 x 16K memory banking
Disk I/O via an ESP interface, unfortunately with no direct block I/O and
with gaps in the tcp: VFS that mean we can't use it for a socket API

TODO
- ESP32 interface lib
- Disk driver
- RTC driver
- Set up when start
- Boot loader
- Input device (joystick, mouse, keyboard)
- Video support for 40/80 col
- Video support for bitmap modes (font space where ?)
- Graphics ioctls
- Tilemap mode has 512 tokens so we need to sort that as with some other
  targets (do 256 for now)
- Interrupt off video, set ram speed, irqmask etc
- Loader
- Multiple consoles

Modes

8K 1bpp		char sized colour table follows bitmap
16K 4bpp	16 colours per pixel through colour table
64x32 tilemap	512 tiles with priority,v/h flip and palette

Sprites on top

Cannot have bitmap and tile at once but text is independent
