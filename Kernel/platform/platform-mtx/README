TODO
DONE	- Fix the configuration for maximum memory banks
DONE	- Autodetect the propeller MTX 80 column card on 0x60/61
IP	- Driver for the propellor 80 column card
	  (need to switch to a proper vt driver)
DONE	- Probe what memory banks are present up to the full 640K that might be present
DONE	- Support for the retro adapters (CF2+ etc)
IP	   - need to auto handle CF1 v CF2
- Autodetect silicon ramdisk
DONE	- Figure out the DPB and how to get images onto the CF for ROM CP/M to run
- Floppy features support
DONE	- Get more stuff into discard
DONE	- Dynamic buffer assignment
DONE	- Support swap via CF adapter
DONE	- Add hooks for uadmin to support swapon() so we can handle silicon disk nicely
DONE	- Report graphics capabilities according to card (inc octel modes on
	  80 col)
- UDG support on both VDP and Prop
- Use prop as a slave to vt layer because of awkward prop ctrl codes
DONE	- keyboard etc devinput support
- How to expose effectively having 512 chars (same problem as ubee)
DONE	- How to detect a rememorizer ?
DONE	- VDP high characters as inverses for cursor like RC2014
DONE	- Multiple virtual consoles on VDP only systems
- Colour setting on VDP


The following MTX512 features are supported
- 6845 based colour text display (no attributes yet) as /dev/tty5
  (or propellor based 80 column support).
- VDP based graphics display (equivalent to MSX1 but on ports 1 and 2) as
  /dev/tty1-4. TTY usage is supported.
- Keyboard including shift-F1-F5 to switch tty
- SDX WD1791 style floppy controller at 0x10
- Silicon discs. These are mapped as device 8 not as /dev/hd because their
  contents (on real ones) vanish if you power off.
- CTC timers
- Z80 DART RS232
- Printer

The following are not yet supported
- Colour/attributes on the displays (graphics ioctls)
- FDX SASI DMA controller
- SN76489A sound
- Rememorizer double height mode
- MTXplus VDP9958
- MTXplus DS12887

Bugs:
Autorepeat


The Rememorizer and Rememotech are not fully supported. Adding support for them
should not be difficult.


Memory Management

Memory is split into four banks the decode for which is dependent upon
whether the box is in "ROM based" or "RAM based" mode. The memory is then
switched in 48K banks with a 16K true common.

All memory management is controlled by the page port (port 0). Bit 7 is set
to 1 to turn the ROMs off, bit 4-6 detemine the rom page address, bits 0-3
select the RAM bank. The port is *write only*.

Note that Rememorizer is different, it allows 0x0f to be written to the
low 3 bits of port 0, then port 0xd2, d0, d1 control the 3 16K banks and also
has an SD card. Under Rememorizer you could instead do a 16K banked port and
get better performance and memory usage.


Loading

On the MEMU emulator you can do a fast load for testing as follows

./fullcpm.sh -iobyte 0x80 -addr 0x0100 -mem platform/fuzix.com -addr 0x0100
-serial2-out /dev/tty -diag-console -sdx-mfloppy mfloppy/ref.fs -sdx-tracks
-80 --diag-bad-port

(and add -diag-whatever as needed)

This flips the box into pure RAM mode, loads the image at 0x100 and runs it
from there with the root floppy as mfloppy/ref.fs which needs to be a
suitable image. I'm currently using an 80 track image, but 40 will work
fine (40 in 80 won't yet). It's quicker than booting CP/M and loading
the image.

To build an 80 track image once everthing else is built go into
Standalone/filesystem-src and do

./build-mini-filesystem /tmp/root.fs 128 2560


A 40 track image will need to be hand built with a few of the less useful
utilities removed.

A CF image can be built the normal way with the cfloader.bin on the first
block and the kernel following. It will then honour normal partition table
rules.

TODO
* Load the font in the cfloader - put it before kernel and load to 3C-3F on
  card ready for restore (or save the ROM font ?)
* Find a way to shrink the size of some of it
* Double check autorepeat
* Build CF images and floppy images
* Submit CF emulation to master Memu tree ?
* Put MEMU CF patches somewhere and doc how to use
* Need to compact memory usage somehow
