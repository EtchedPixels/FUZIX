# Amstrad CPC with Standard Memory Expansions

Currently, standard RAM expansions up to 1024KiB are supported using the thunked memory model, alternating complete 64K blocks in the RAM space visible to the CPU. This gives a total amount of 1088K of usable RAM on all Amstrad CPC models.

The memory model from the Cromemco port has been adapted to the Amstrad CPC hardware, and the drivers from the CPC 6128 port have been modified to work with this memory model.

The first 64K, which are the only ones accessible by the video hardware, have been reserved for VRAM. For now, the video driver from the CPC 6128 port has been extended to handle two simultaneous terminals (accessible with CTRL+SHIFT+F1 and CTRL+SHIFT+F2), using the 16K pages located at 0x4000 and 0x8000, by configuring the memory mode corresponding to value 0xC1 in the Gate Array's MMR register. The 0x0000 page hasn't been used yet, as it interferes with the RST call execution area, and the 0xC000 page hasn't been used so far because it's not accessible with the 0xC1 MMR value. It could probably be used by switching to 0xC3, as done in the CPC 6128 port. The use of the remaining 16K pages of VRAM to implement four terminals is left for the future.

The kernel reserves the second 64K block, leaving up to 15 blocks of 64K available for up to 15 user processes with a 1024KiB RAM expansion.

The upper 4K of each block are used as common memory so 60KiB are available for each process.


## Memory Model

Bank 0      Video RAM
            0000-3FFF vectors (future tty?)
            4000-7FFF tty1
            8000-BFFF tty2
            C000-FFFF unused (future tty)

Bank 1		Kernel
		0000-00FF, F200-FFFF are propogated into the other banks

Bank 2-16	User
		0000-00FF start with shared vectors
			  FIXME: we need to clean this up in program_vectors
			  from the kernel copy ????
		0100-EFFF application
		F000-F1FF udata copy for this application
		F200-FFFF common copy

## STATUS

Video mode 2 is used. The video driver configures the CRTC in 64x32 characters to do easy hardware scroll and use the whole video memory bank.

The floppy driver seems to work. /dev/fd0 is drive A and /dev/fd1 is drive B. fd0 is hard coded to one side and fd1 to double side. A minimal system
root disk image is generated to boot from fd1. Format is 9 sectors per track with sector ID from 1 to 9.

The IDE driver works and the USB mass storage of the Albireo using the ch375 driver used in other platforms also works. It should be easy to get it working with the Usifac/Ulifac and a second Albireo with alternate I/O ports.

The Makefile generate a dsk image (fuzix.dsk) to load Fuzix form basic with run"fuzix" command. Also a snapshot is generated as alternative load method.

To test it burn disk.img on your mass storage media. Load an run the snapshot or use fuzix.dsk image to run it from basic.

Added support for the USIFAC serial port. If CONFIG_USIFAC_SERIAL is defined in config.h, the tty3 device is added. To use the console on this device,
modify the following line in /etc/inittab:
03:3:off:getty /dev/tty3
to:
03:3:respawn:getty /dev/tty3
This has been tested with Putty conecting the usifac to a linux box using a USB-Serial converter and works wery well. By default the usifac is set at
115200 baud with no flow control.


## TODO

Configurable screen, at least add 80x25, maybe also change the video mode and routines to manage 6x8 fonts.
Support more hardware: M4 Board (storage, network and RTC), Ulifac/Usifac storage, networking with wifi module plugged in the usifac, sdcard in the
Albireo.

Fix lots of bugs.

Look for speed optimization opportunities.

## BUILD & RUN

Install cpctools: https://github.com/cpcsdk/cpctools
install hex2bin: https://github.com/algodesigner/hex2bin
install iDSK: https://github.com/cpcsdk/idsk
install flip

make TARGET=cpcsme diskimage

.sna snapshot, .dsk boot disk image and mass storage filesystem images are generated in Images folder.

For booting from floppy execute RUN"FUZIX at basic prompt

To run on emulator use ACE-DL emulator and use disk.img as image for the x-mass IDE interface emulation.
