Experimental port for the Simple80 mainboard plus CF card plus RTC or CTC card

Required firmware: Simple 80 CP/M ROM 0.12 or higher

Cards required:

Simple 80 processor board (with the A16 fix)
Simple 80 CF adapter (RC2014 can probably be used as it decodes 0x90)
RTC at 0xC0 (optional)
CTC at 0xD0 (to avoid clashes with the above)

Either SC102 Z80 CTC (strongly recommended) or RC2014 RTC. If you have both you
get the best of both worlds. A standard crystal is assumed. The CTC should also
be set to count timer 2 into timer 3 (jumper ZT2 to CT3).

This is a design that happens to have 128K RAM but the 64K banks are flipped
directly. The boot EEPROM must contain firmware that loads a copier into the
top 256 bytes of both RAM banks.

A16 Fix:

The version 1 simple80 design has a pull up R16 that should be a pull down.

Memory map

Kernel

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	Kernel (common above 0x8000 for ROM dodging)
F000-F1FF	UDATA
F200-F2FF	Istack
F300-FFFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)

User

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	User space
F000-F1FF	Kernel stack alternative (used during some bank switch ops)
F200-F2FF	Istack alternate (we may take interrupts in either bank)
F300-FFFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)

TODO

Faster interbank copying
Swap only needed blocks for speed up
Finish support for the SIO modifications and alternate banking
Maybe support the buggy boards (means no second serial port)
Support the 150Hz clock board
Fork a 512K RAM modified version

Build Instructions

make diskimage will leave you a ready to run disk and emulator image.

The emulator can run it with

	simple80 -i emu-ide.img -r cpm80.rom

The boot code is designed to boot from the ROM based CP/M option (see my github) not the
Bill Shen monitor.

Detail:

Emulation

Write the bootloader once to block 0x00 with partitions 
Write kernel images to block 0x01-0x7F
Make it into a disk image

Real Hardware

Partition the CF card with a standard partitioning tool so it has the normal
sector 2048 start for the file systems.
Add the bootloader to block 0 of a CF card
Set up a partition (type 7E) for Fuzix and put a Fuzix root file system on it
using dd or similar raw tools
Set up a second partition (type 7F) as swap.

You can partition the rest of the card however you want.

Boot the machine with the card present and the ROM will see a bootable CF
card and boot from it.
