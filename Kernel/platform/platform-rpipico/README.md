# The Raspberry Pi Pico port

## Introduction

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a very small and very cheap microcontroller board
based around the Raspberry Pi Foundation's RP2040 chip. It's got two Cortex-M0+
cores, 2MB of onboard NAND flash which can be used for code via a demand-paging
system, and 264kB of RAM.

The Fuzix port runs in cooperative multitasking mode with the root filesystem
on NAND, and with an optional SD card on the second SPI interface for anything
else. It supports both console over UART and it'll also pretend to be a USB
serial device. There's enough memory to run four or five processes at once, and
you can enable swapping to the SD card for up to 15.

## Configuration

Out of the box:

  - /dev/hda is the NAND flash, containing the root filesystem. It can be
	partitioned but there's no real point, so it isn't.

  - /dev/hdb is the SD card. Fuzix understands DOS partition tables. It's not
	hot swappable as the SD card is only probed at boot time.

If you have an SD card reader, connect the SD card to the following pins:

        Pico pin     RP2040 pin    SD card pin
        --------------------------------------
           16           12            MISO
           17           13             CS
           19           14            SCK
           20           15            MOSI

Remember to also connect the SD card's GND to any Raspberry Pico GND pin and Vcc to
3.3V. Not 5V, or it won't work.

The console is accessible either via UART0 (at 115200 baud) or by connecting
the Pico up via USB to a PC, at which point it'll present itself as a standard
USB CDC serial device. Both work simultaneously although odd things can happen
if you type on both concurrently.

**Note:** when using the USB console, you're unlikely to be able to connect
quickly enough after boot to see the startup messages. Most likely when you
connect, the Pico will be sitting waiting at the prompt to set the time. Press
RETURN a few times to get to the getty login prompt.

## Building and installation

You need to install the [Raspberry Pi Pico SDK](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/).

```
cd Kernel/platform-rpipico
vi Makefile
# At this point, you need to edit the Makefile to tell it where the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK lives.
make image -j
```

You should now end up with `build/fuzix.uf2` and `filesystem.uf2`. The `uf2`
files can be flashed onto the Pico in the usual way (i.e. connect it up as a
mass storage device and copy the files on). Alternatively, you can use OpenOCD
to load `build/fuzix.elf`. Once the board has rebooted it will appear as a USB
serial device which you can connect to. Alternatively, connect a terminal to
UART 0 on the Pico.

If you want to use an SD card, note that only filesystems up to 32MB are
supported. To format a file system, do this from the Fuzix shell:

```
$ mkfs -f /dev/hdb1 32 65535
```

The last argument is the filesystem size in 512-byte blocks.

The first thing you probably want to do is `stty erase '^?'` to make the DELETE
key in your terminal work properly. (Use the `levee` editor to add it to
`$HOME/.profile`.)

## Userland

The Pico Fuzix port runs generic Cortex M0 ELF pie binaries, which are
theoretically portable to other ARM or Cortex devices, but this hasn't been
tried yet. There's 64kB available for both code and data; the system call
interface uses `svc`.

The Pico's mask ROM contains many useful routines which can be used instead of
libgcc, which would reduce the binary size. This hasn't been done yet because
it would render the binaries non-portable.

There's a Forth interpreter as `fforth` (use capital letters) and some games
are in `/usr/games`.

## Swap

Out of the box, Fuzix runs in swapless mode. This gives enough memory to run
most normal programs (you can use `free` to see how much you have left). If you
want more, you can enable swapping to the SD card.

To do this, create a partition of up to 2048kB (4096 blocks) on the SD card.
Then use the `swapon` command to enable swap. You can see swap usage with
`free`.

```
# fdisk -l
                      START                  END
Device    Boot  Head Sector Cylinder   Head Sector Cylinder  Type  Sector count

/dev/hdb1        33      3        0     38      6        1    83          4096
/dev/hdb2        38      7        1     58      8       18    83         65536
# swapon /dev/hdb1 4096
# free
         total         used         free
Mem:       160           56          104
Swap:     2048            0         2048
# 
```

You can't turn swap off again.

You probably can swap to the NAND flash, but it's a terrible idea.

## Boot device

Edit config.h to select appropriate boot device.

`#define BOOTDEVICE 0x0000` - for NAND flash (hda)

`#define BOOTDEVICE 0x0011` - for the first partioin on the SD card (hdb1)

## Using the NAND flash

The Pico's built-in NAND flash is supported, appearing as `/dev/hda` insize
Fuzix (the SD card is on `/dev/hdb`).  It's mapped via the Dhara FTL library,
so you get proper wear levelling.  The FTL library requires empty flash sectors
to work efficiently; the Fuzix filesystem has trim support, so the FTL library
gets notified when sectors become free, but if the filesystem gets very full
and Dhara runs out it can get extremely slow as it constantly does garbage
collection.

## Using SD Card

1. Create dos partition table
    * Partition 1: 32MB partition
    * Partition 2: 4MB partition (optional)
2. Run `dd if=filesystem.img bs=512 seek=2048 of=/dev/sdX conv=notrunc status=progress` to copy image onto SD card. (**Be careful to not damage your system drive**)

## Issues

There are many, the biggest of which are:

  - CPU exceptions should be mapped to signals.

...and probably others.
