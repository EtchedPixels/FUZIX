Fuzix for the ZX-Uno

For the 128K spectrum we get 8 pages of 16K, all can be stuffed into the top
16K but some are also wired to other things or hardwired elsewhere.

The ZX-Uno DIVMMC allows us to do

0xE3:	7: conmem 6: mapram 0-5: bank
	(may only be 4 banks)

	7 set ROM at 0000-1FFF and RAM at 2000-3FFF (banked)
	and pins it (overrides 6)
	6 is a one shot and write protects bank 3 and places it at
	0000-1FFF, 
	5-0: are the bank at 2000-3FFF

To load we use the ESXDOS extension that is generally found with most
DivMMC and DivIDE interfaces. Copy FUZIX.BIN into / on the ESXDOS drive and
copy FUZIX into BIN. Then boot from ESXDOS with .fuzix

We run with the following mapping

0000-1FFF	IRQ vectors and boot loader
2000-3FFF	RAM (switchable): Common, const, commondata etc
		(we have 2 spare banks here but it's not clear what use they
		actually are).

4000-5FFF	A bit more kernel space right now (need to sort out external
		buffers)

6000-BFFF	User space (DOCK, EXT or main memory)

C000-FFFF	Banked
	0:	Kernel CODE (fairly full)
	1:	Kernel CODE2 (fairly full)
	2:	Mapped at 0x8000-0xBFFF
	3:	Spare
	4:	Top of user process in main memory
	5:	Mapped at 0x4000-0x7FFF (some kernel, some user)
	6:	CODE3, (lots of room) - buffers here ? when banked ?
	7:	Screen memory, only accessed from common. Need to put
		the font in the gaps here.

We can move some stuff down into the low 16K (especially once we move the
common space) We do need to do sort things out a bit and stuff commonmem etc
in the low 8K to get more room.

To Do:

-	Why does ls /bin lose the lowest pixel row of the 'yes' command ?
	(Seems we lose the bottom line of the left most char - off by one bug
	 in zxvid ?)
-	Hand optimized bank exchange and bank to bank copy routines. These are
	fairly performance critical due to the limitations of the memory model.
	Right now we ldir in one case (could be faster abusing stack), and
	the exchange case could be made much much faster using registers
	and stack tricks not bounce buffers
-	Enable interrupts during swap
-	6 or 5bit wide fonts (42, 51 column)
-	Optimize zxvid - especially scrolling
-	Move vtborder to common
-	Enable 64 column (512 pixel wide) mode on the Uno
-	Use the Timex MMU DOCK/EXT memory for multiple banks of user code


Working Notes
- 	Need to update video code to use bank 7, right now it scribbles over
	0x4000
