COCO2
=====

COCO or Dragon 64 with an IDE port, cartridge and 64K of RAM

Supported hardware:
	IDE (Cloud9 or compatible set at FF50) with either built in
		cartridge RAM or separate cartridge
	COCO SDC

Please see config.h to select SDC or IDE support. There isn't room in such
a small space for both and for a full high res display.

Disk Layout
===========

Standard disk partitions are not handled due to limited memory. Instead each
minor number corresponds to a 32MB slice of disc. Slice 0 holds the kernel image
and the rest is used for swapping processes. Slice 1 then normally holds the
first file system and so on. Add 128 for the second disc. Remember to keep
all of them under the offset you have set in the HDBDOS ROM for your disk
basic floppy images.

Memory Map
==========

User View
=========
0000-00FF	Interrupt stack
0100-01FF	Vectors plus the swap stack
0200-19FF	Display
1A00-1BFF	udata/stack
1C00-7FFF	Common, data and some kernel code
8000-FDFF	User space
FE00-FEFF	Free
FF00-FFFF	I/O etc

Kernel Mode View
================
0000-00FF	Interrupt stack
0100-01FF	Vectors plus swap stack
0200-19FF	Display
1A00-1BFF	udata/stack
1C00-7FFF	Common, data and some kernel code
8000-BFFF	ROM
C000-FEFF	Kernel
FF00-FFFF	I/O etc


Emulating in XRoar
==================

No support for COCOSDC emulation in xroar as of 0.33.2

TODO
====

Make the boot loader robust (timeout handling)
Add hash of code not just simple magic - so we know bits match

Support for a real time clock and clock locking

We should be totally clean now on FIR blocking, so audio might
actually be doable if not doing drivewire.

See if given an extra loader a 64K machine with Tormod's 32K RAM cart would
work.

To Test
=======

make diskimage
This will produce a disk.img and a pair of ROM files in Images/coco2cart

In the xroar directory where you have a hard disc image do

xroar -default-machine dragon64 -cart ide -cart-rom fuzixide.rom -load-hd0 disk.img

exec 49152

A 32MB filesystem can be put in slice 1 using dd with an offset of 32MB + 2
sectors.

For the CocoSDC the same procedure applies (without an emulator however) but
using the fuzixsdc rom and SD image.
