This is Fuzix for the N8VEM Mark IV SBC
By Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

Supported hardware:
 - Real time clock
 - IDE interface
 - SD interface
 - RS232 serial port (ASCI channel 0, tty1)
 - RS422 serial port (ASCI channel 1, tty2)
 - PropIO V2 serial port (tty3, optional)

The PropIO V2 can be enabled by editing config.h and setting PROPIO2_IO_BASE to
the base IO port address of the board. If enabled, the PropIO will be used as
the system console.

To build the kernel, edit the CPU and TARGET lines in Kernel/Makefile to read:
    export TARGET=n8vem-mark4
    export CPU=z180
Then run "make clean; make all" in the "Kernel" directory.

There are two ways to boot the system.

The file "Kernel/platform-n8vem-mark4/fuzix.com" is a CP/M executable which
will load and boot the Fuzix kernel from within CP/M. This works well, however
the kernel is now starting to get quite large and may be too large for CP/M to
load.

The file "Kernel/platform-n8vem-mark4/diskboot.bin" is an UNA BIOS compatible
boot sector which will allow the system to be booted directly from an IDE or SD
drive. The boot sector will load the kernel image starting from the third
sector of the drive.

The kernel image (fuzix.bin) should be written to the disk drive from the third
sector onwards, in the space before the first partition starts. Be careful to
ensure there is sufficient space before the first partition to hold the kernel
or you risk overwriting the filesystem in the first partition! Modern disk
partitioning programs generally start the first partition at 1MB (sector 2048)
and thus allow plenty of space.

To check the space before the first partition, use "fdisk -l /dev/sdX" and
check the value in the "Start" column for the first partition. If this number
is 128 or larger, there is sufficient space.

To write the boot sector to a disk drive, without overwriting the partition
table, you can use dd as follows;
    dd if=diskboot.bin bs=446 count=1 of=/dev/sdX

To write the kernel image to the disk drive, use dd as follows;
    dd if=fuzix.bin bs=512 seek=2 of=/dev/sdX

When booting the system from both UNA BIOS and CP/M you can specify the root
filesystem device number on the command line after the command name or unit
number.
