Experimental port for the SC108 mainboard plus CF card plus RTC or CTC card, or
for the SC114 combo mainboard/backplane. Should also work with the SC707 but
this has not been tested yet.

Cards required:

SC108 processor module or SC114 motherboard
SC104 Z80 SIO/2 (or RC2014 SIO/2 card)
RC2014 CF adapter

Either SC102 Z80 CTC (recommended) or RC2014 RTC. If you have both you get the
best of both worlds. The CTC should be jumpered to provide CLK2 to the second
SIO channel to get baud rate control. A standard crystal is assumed. The CTC
should also be set to count timer 2 into timer 3 (jumper ZT2 to CT3)

Not tested at this point
ACIA based serial

Unsupported

Bitbang I/O port.

You can probably use the SC110 instead of the SC102 and SC104 but you will need
to run a wire to chain CTC2 into CTC3 with the current board revision.

This is a design that happens to have 128K RAM but the 64K banks are flipped
directly. Fortunately there is a ROM which lives in both banks.

For the moment we stick the OS in RAM (it would be entertaining to explore
putting the kernel in ROM but as it's not trivially reprogrammable flash
lets leave that for a while).

If you have a current SC114 ROM or you build the latest SC108 ROM from source
the ROM containers helper functions for the bank setup. We can't actually use
those the way it was intended as the bootstrap blows away the monitor state
before we can intercept it instead we scan the ROM and find it.

If you have an older SC108 ROM then it tries 0x7FFD and the code used to get
this to work originally. (See README.ROMpatch)

Memory map

Kernel

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	Kernel (common above 0x8000 for ROM dodging)
F000-F1FF	UDATA
F200-F2FF	Istack
F300-FFFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)

User

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	User space
F000-F1FF	Kernel stack alternative (used during some bank switch ops)
F200-F2FF	Istack alternate (we may take interrupts in either bank)
F300-FFFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)

TO DO
Support setting the serial clocks and CTC maps with a tool
Support the bitbang port for output only (copy kputchar and outchar there for debugging ?)
Use the extra space to put back some kernel bits we binned from -tiny
Build a suitably high CP/M emuation and test it

Faster interbank copying
Swap only needed blocks for speed up

Long term fun
- OS core in ROM, high memory holding rest (like -tiny) but with two user space
banks ??

Bulding:

make diskimage will build a set of images ready to use, one for ACIA and
one for the SIO. Only the loader actually differs.

Emulation

Write the bootloader once to block 0 (repair the parition tables afterwards)
Write kernel images to block 24
Make it into a disk image
rc2014 -m sc108 -r sc108.rom -s -i sc108.ide -c

Real Hardware

Add the bootloader to block 0 of a CF card
Partition the CF card with a standard partitioning tool so it has the normal
sector 2048 start for the file systems.
Set up a partition (type 7E) for Fuzix and put a Fuzix root file system on it
using dd or similar raw tools
Set up a second partition (type 7F) as swap.

You can partition the rest of the card however you want.

Boot the machine and in the monitor run the CPM command.
