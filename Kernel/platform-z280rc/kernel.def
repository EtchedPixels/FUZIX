;	FUZIX mnemonics for memory addresses etc
;
;
;	The U_DATA address. If we are doing a normal build this is the start
;	of common memory. We do actually have a symbol for udata so
;	eventually this needs to go away
;
U_DATA__TOTALSIZE           .equ 0x200        ; 256+256 bytes@E000
;
;	Space for the udata of a switched out process within the bank of
;	memory that it uses. Normally placed at the very top
;
U_DATA_STASH		    .equ 0xDE00	      ; DE00-DFFF
;
;	Z80 systems start program space at 0, and load at 0x100 so that the
;	low 256 bytes are free for syscall vectors and the like, with some
;	also used as a special case by the CP/M emulator.
;
PROGBASE		    .equ 0x0000
PROGLOAD		    .equ 0x0100
;
;	CPU type
;	0 = CMOS Z80 (set this for Z280 for now)
;	1 = NMOS Z80 (also works with CMOS)
;	2 = Z180
;
;	If either NMOS or CMOS may be present pick NMOS as the NMOS build
;	contains extra code to work around an erratum n the NUMS Z80
;
Z80_TYPE		    .equ 0
;
;	For special platforms that have external memory protection hardware
;	Just say 0.
;
Z80_MMU_HOOKS		    .equ 0
;
;	Set this if the platform has swap enabled in config.h
;
CONFIG_SWAP		    .equ 1
;
;	The number of disk buffers. Must match config.h
;
NBUFS			    .equ 5
