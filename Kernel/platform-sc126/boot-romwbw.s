;
;	ROMWBW boot block
;
;	The provided bootloader is a bit limited. It can only really load
;	stuff into upper memory and assumes CP/M is being loaded
;
;	Unfortunately this means we have to chain our own loader.
;	Fortunately ROMWBW is really quite nice so it's easy to use to do
;	the load. What it can't do however is do I/O into the low 32K
;	directly - it has no separate I/O target page feature it seems.
;
;	We build the lot as if it's a binary at 0xF000 as that's easier than
;	fighting the linker and the like
;
;	The end must actually be the byte after we need. ROMWBW explodes
;	if given F200 F3FF !
;
;	ROMWBW 2.9.1 has an undocumented antisocial habit - it enables
;	interrupts even if called with them disabled. Work around this
;	by turnign them back off when we need too

;	This should be 0xF200. We are entered with the stack somewhere
;	in the middle of RAM, HBIOS stubs in the top 2 pages and RAM
;	low including our expected RST hooks for HBIOS
;
;	We need to go get our device/subunit back from the BIOS because
;	it's has RST 8 interfaces for this rather than just passing
;	them in a register.
;
;	For now we can do a simple load as we fit in 64K easily. If we
;	add networking we might have to get clever.
