Experimental porting work for ZX Spectrum 128K systems that have the ability
to somehow get the low 16K mapped with our code. That makes it a lot more
practical and a lot of interfaces let us do this, plus a lot of the clones
support putting RAM low for CP/M.

----



Fuzix for the 128K Spectrum and clones with DivIDE or DivMMC mapping
functions. These machines all have the same basic problem, there is a 16K
window at C000-FFFF which is pageable but no big paging.

For the 128K spectrum we get 8 pages of 16K, all can be stuffed into the top
16K but some are also wired to other things or hardwired elsewhere.

DivIDE and DIVMMC we do
0xE3:	7: conmem 6: mapram 0-5: bank
	(may only be 4 banks)

	7 set ROM at 0000-1FFF and RAM at 2000-3FFF (banked)
	and pins it (overrides 6)
	6 is a one shot and write protects bank 3 and places it at
	0000-1FFF, 
	5-0: are the bank at 2000-3FFF

To load we use the ESXDOS extension that is generally found with most
DivMMC and DivIDE interfaces. Copy FUZIX.BIN into / on the ESXDOS drive and
copy FUZIX into BIN. Then boot from ESXDOS with .fuzix

Alternatively you can use FATWARE 0.14 for an autoboot by placing BOOT.BIN
in \fatware and placing the strap.bin on the second sector onwards of the disk
image in the boot area before your partitions (make sure your media is
partitioned for more than 63 boot sectors). If using an hdf image you can dd to
byte 1046 onwards. Only DivIDE is supported for the autoboot trick.

We run with the following mapping

0000-1FFF	IRQ vectors and boot loader
2000-3FFF	RAM (switchable): Common, const, commondata etc
		(we have 2 spare banks here but it's not clear what use they
		actually are).

4000-5FFF	Spectrum screen memory and system variables
6000-7FFF	Kernel data

		[Note: keeping the video mapped is important for graphics
		 and also means you can use it with the 128K/512K external
		 48K expansions that do paging but don't do ROM switching
		 or video switching. These have page 5 not the same as
		 4000-7FFF so our loader may need a rework]

8000-83FF	Needed to create the exec of init
8400-BFFF	_DISCARD area - blown away when we exec init
		(tons of room in this space)

C000-FFFF
	0:	Kernel CODE (fairly full)
	1:	Kernel CODE2 (fairly full)
	2:	Mapped at 0x8000-0xBFFF (exchanged with user process buffer)
	3:	User process
	4:	User process
	5:	Mapped at 0x4000-0x7FFF (Sceen, Kernel data/common)
	6:	User process (holds the 0x8000-BFFF of the other task)
	7:	CODE3, Video (lots of room)

We can move some stuff down into the low 16K (especially once we move the
common space) We do need to do sort things out a bit and stuff commonmem etc
in the low 8K to get more room.

User processes live in 2/3 or 2/4. Because we can't swap the lower 16K
around we exchange it with bank 6 as we go.

To Do:

-	Why does ls /bin lose the lowest pixel row of the 'yes' command ?
	(Seems we lose the bottom line of the left most char - off by one bug
	 in zxvid ?)
-	If loading via ESX works remove the old clunky loader and fix reboot
-	Hand optimized bank exchange and bank to bank copy routines. These are
	fairly performance critical due to the limitations of the memory model.
	Right now we ldir in one case (could be faster abusing stack), and
	the exchange case could be made much much faster using registers
	and stack tricks not bounce buffers
-	Enable interrupts during swap
-	Look at what is needed for other suitable interfaces. DIVMMC would
	in particular be good to support but that means another harder
	bootloader hack
-	6 or 5bit wide fonts (42, 51 column)
-	Optimize zxvid - especially scrolling
-	Many of the later Russian clones support putting bank 0 in the low
	16K, and more than 8 banks. That would need some changes to the bank
	logic and some interesting detection code. Also they have rather
	different IDE mappings (SMUC on the Scorpion for example)
-	Later DivIDE and DivMMC support both a 16K page mode and a lot more
	RAM (up to 512K). That at the very least would make a kick ass
	ramdisc/swap device even if the unit lacks the allram switch
	(May also make sense to hae a build 'the other way up' where we
	page apps out of 0000-3FFF copying 4000-7FFF for allram devices on
	a 128K machine
-	Speccyboot (ENC28J60)
-	SpectraNet (W5100)
-	Move vtborder to common


Devices To Look At:

DIVIDE:		These have at least 32K of 8K banks. They are awkward to use
DIVMMC:		however because you cannot set all of it to RAM and r/w
		Big ones have up to 512K of RAM (idea for ramdisk), some
		even battery backup and 16K mode.
ZXATASP:	PPIDE for spectrum with a 16K low memory paging thing ?
ZXCF:		Similar CF adapter, 64 banks of 16K write protectable
		memory in 0000-3FFF
ZXMMC:		Appears to have no RAM attached so not much use
Simple IDE:	Same problem but can often co-exist with others.
SpectraNet:	Diskless Fuzix 8)

Floppy disk interfaces are problematic. The standard Betadisk interface locks
the I/O ports to its ROM being active, which sucks. The Disciple might be
doable, need to check the locking and ports.

To set up

make

Set up the HDF and partition it so you've got the 2048 boot sectors from
a modern fdisk
Mark partition 1 FAT and bootable
hdfmonkey put my.hdf BOOT.BIN /fatware/BOOT.BIN
dd if=strap.bin of=my.hdf bs=1046 seek=1 conv=notrunc

and you can stick the Fuzix partitions on partion 2+ along with a swap
partition (required). 0x7E fuzix 0x7F swap


Other option to investigate - unbanked mode

0000-1FFF	Kernel commonmem and writables plus bootstrap
2000-7FFF	Kernel code/data
1:C000-FFFF	Kernel code/data
7:C000-FFFF	Kernel buffers/video RAM

8000-FFFF	User space

That would give us a straight 48K for the kernel, 32K user spaces
and page mappings of

0:	??? (Russian clones low 16K RAM), maybe a networking/driver helper bank ?
1:	Kernel code/data
2:	8000-BFFF hardwired
3:	User high
4:	User high
5:	4000-7FFF hardwired (Kernel code/data)
6:	Exchange with 2
7:	Kernel buffers/video/font code

Other question: does this mean we need two builds

1.	Classic low memory divmmc etc - 8000-FFFF user
	as above

2.	Big DivMMC/ZXCF etc where there is a 16K bank mode and more
	RAM in the DivMMC than the system

	0000-3FFF: user / kernel common
	4000-7FFF: user (copied)
	8000-BFFF: kernel fixed
	C000-FFFF: kernel and video and some more user pages for copying

Eg with a 512K DivIDE that would give us over 32K pages so 16 processes without
hassle.

Could we jump up and down on it enough to get user to be a bit bigger than 32K
and if so where and how do we handle the extra



DONE	-	Get the DivIDE interface working
DONE	-	See what we can get below 0x2000
DONE	-	Review DivIDE writes - is the port aliasing safe with a full
	otir or do we need to avoid port aliasing ? - safe
DONE	-	Crash when we fork() or switch ?
DONE	-	Check the swap hooks are ok
DONE	-	Turn on swap so we can make progress
DONE	-	Debug crash on swapping
DONE	-	Hangs on pause(). Review p->p_timeout behaviour
DONE	-	Crash on pre-emption, appears to be a bug in fuse-1.5.4
		(moved code/consts to avoid Fuse bug, filed Fuse bug)
DONE	-	Move video to 4000 and data to 6000 so that we have video
		direct mappable by user space and also make it easier if we
		have to work via ROMs that want spectrum system variable stuff
DONE	-	Colour attributes
DONE	-	Graphics mapping
DONE	-	Kempston joystick and mouse
DONE	-	Finish off testing the ESX loader
