/*
 *	The ZX Spectrum 128 has 8 banks all of which can appear in the top 16K
 *	but two of whom are permanently wired to appear at 0x4000 and 0x8000.
 *
 *	The Russian clones (Pentagon, Scorpion etc) generally also have a way
 *	to place bank 0 in 0000-3FFF
 *
 *	There is no way to switch the 4000-BFFF space so we have to block
 *	copy stuff around (gak).
 *
 *	For now we just handle the 128K spectrum. The pages are allocated as
 *	follows
 *
 *	0 Kernel code bank 1 at C000-FFFF 	(will need to change for
 *						 pentagon/scorpion)
 *	1 Kernel code bank 2 at C000-FFFF
 *	2 Hardwired at 0x8000-0xBFFF (User space)
 *	3 User space top 16K for process
 *	4 User space too 16K for other process
 *	5 Hardwired at 0x4000-0x7FFF (main screen - we don't use) Kernel data
 *	6 Exchanged with page 2 on task switches
 *	7 Hardwired for shadow screen (the one we use) at C000 for 6912 bytes
 *	We use this for video and code bank 3 at C000-FFFF 
 *
 *	The Pentagon goes up to 1MB, all in top 16K banks. Page 0 can be
 *	assigned to the low 16K space. The Scorpion is similar but they don't
 *	quite agree on which bits do what.
 *
 *	The current code just hands out 4 and 3 and relies upon knowing that
 *	you always exchange 6 and 2. That won't work once we expand to the
 *	better systems.
 *
 *	To confuse things further RAM banks 1/3/5/7 are slower (it's not quite
 *	the same on the clones). We might want to juggle a few things around
 *	for best speed.
