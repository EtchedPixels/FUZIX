;	bitbangers as the PS/2 port provides the clocking for us
;
;	We take pains to generate port output with B no zero so that we
;	can (with care) map this over a Z180 port that is only used at
;	setup time.
;
;	TODO: longer duration errors.
;	2ms: longest a send should ever take
;	15ms: longest we should ever have to wait for clocks when we ask
;	to tx
;	20ms: longest a command reply should take
;
;	Assumes <= 8MHz processor (so 125uS is 1000 clocks)
