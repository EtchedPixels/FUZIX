Fuzix for a slightly modified Grant Searle board

The first modification is to use the W/RDYB pin to control A16 of the 628128
(pin 2) which is grounded. Bend up the pin, and wire it to W/RDYB (30) on
the SIO. Wire a 4K7 pull up to that link. This trick was taken from Bill
Shen's Simple80 design.

The second modification is to bend up DCDA on the SIO-2 and wire it to a
8Hz square wave source. The board as designed has no timer source as CP/M
2.2 doesn't actually need one. There are plenty of ways to make an 8Hz
square wave circuit, including these days just using one of the tiny PIC
devices to count it.

(Other frequencies will do but I happen to own an 8Hz source). Set the
clock frequency in config.h and fiddle as needed with devtty.c as the
kernel needs to see a clock divisible by 10 so some fudging is done).

Finally you need my revised ROM that copies a bank to bank helper into both
RAM banks before paging the ROM out. See monitor.diff for the patch to the
supplied monitor.asm.

Memory map

Kernel

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	Kernel (common above 0x8000 for ROM dodging)
F000-F1FF	UDATA
F200-F2FF	Istack
F300-FEFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)
FF00-FFFF	ROM helper copy

User

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	User space
F000-F1FF	Kernel stack alternative (used during some bank switch ops)
F200-F2FF	Istack alternate (we may take interrupts in either bank)
F300-FEFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)
FF00-FFFF	ROM helper copy

BUGS
Assumes console is SIOA (the TTL port)

TO DO
The ROM turns off write caching which trashes performance and lifetime so
	we should turn it back on for Fuzix (or just fix the ROM)
Pick up console from A on entry to loader and if need tbe flip tty1/2 ?
Build a suitably high CP/M emuation and test it
Faster interbank copying
Swap only needed blocks for speed up
Replace the monitor with something much nicer

Emulation

Write the bootloader once to block 0 (repair the parition tables afterwards)
Write kernel images to block 24
Make it into a disk image

searle -r scm.rom -i fuzix.ide -b -t 

Real Hardware

Add the bootloader to block 0 of a CF card
Partition the CF card with a standard partitioning tool so it has the normal
sector 2048 start for the file systems.
Set up a partition (type 7E) for Fuzix and put a Fuzix root file system on it
using dd or similar raw tools
Set up a second partition (type 7F) as swap.

You can partition the rest of the card however you want.

Boot the machine and in the monitor run the CPM command.
