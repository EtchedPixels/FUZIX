/*
 *	Flat memory manager taken from the original MAPUX work by
 *	Martin Young. "Do what you want with it" licence.
 *
 *	This version has been tidied up and ANSIfied
 *
 *	The code needs some work, particularly on the efficiency side. On the
 *	plus side however it does allow us to do brk() properly, it handles
 *	fork() and it does allow memory compaction and rearrangement as well
 *	as expanding to support multi-segment binaries and relocations not
 *	just binfmt_flat (eg Amiga style).
 *
 *	TODO:
 *		Further type cleaning
 *		Allow for multiple memory pools. This isn't totally trivial
 *			because we cannot merge across pools.
 *		Integrate swapping
 *		See if it's actually worth the overhead. In particular see
 *			what occurs when combines with swapping. Arguably with
 *			hard disc we we want to favour swapping over colaescing.
 *		Support read-only blocks (duplicate by ref count) for pure
 *		code segments and for re-entrant executables (and shared libs)
 *		Optimizations (list splitting etc)
 *		Pinning. This is actually quite hairy because we need to know
 *		that the address we are pinning has *no* users in any list.
 *		That will require better data structures for va management.
 *
 *	SWAPPING:
 *		Two options
 *		- we swap out processes (remembering the outgoing process
 *		might not be identity mapped) but we then need to implement
 *		a hole list for swap, and coalescing and the like
 *		- we have a memblk entry for each page of RAM or swap and
 *		we keep track of whether the 'page' is in RAM or swap. That
 *		lets us do partial swap outs, swap out non identity mapped
 *		pages first and try other things of that kind. At the
 *		moment any memblk has a pa and va and we fast_swap_block
 *		when we need too. Disk swapping would push them out to
 *		the end part of the array that didn't exist in RAM but isn't
 *		quite the same as 'exchange' isn't a disk function. Swap in
 *		would magically happen as part of vmmu_setcontext, the
 *		array offset tells us where in swap and we don't have to
 *		coalesce.
