ZX Spectrum +2A/+3

The memory mapping on this machine is a bit friendlier but it's still single
(large) process in memory at a time to get the best result. Banked kernel
2 x 32K is also doable but probably not such a good use of the machine

Note:

We keep the discard high up below the common because otherwise the packed
image overlaps itself and the ldir into discard corrupts the image

Memory Model

We use +2A/+3 'special paging mode'. It's special, but limited. Sufficient for
a nice one process in memory model however

One quirk of this box is that banks 4-7 run at an effective 2.5-3Mhz due to
video wait states but 0-3 run the full 3.5. Thus we want to land some things
in 0-3 and should ponder that carefully.

The plus 3 memory map is fairly simple.

There are four maps

0/1/2/3
4/5/6/7
4/5/6/3
4/7/6/3

and the video can be at the bottom of 5 or 7

As we can't get 5 anywhere convenient video has to go in 7

To get started we run with

User

0 / 1 / 2		Common 3

Kernel

4 / 5 / 6 		Common 3

Video (routines in common)

4 / 7 / 6 		Common 3

External buffers in 7 eventually (using 4/7/6/3 mapping)

Annoyingly there is no easy way to do direct video except maybe once we
do the video in loader hint hack then we can flip the screen to 5 and
load an app from 5D00-wherever. Still ugly.


TODO

Fix memory size reporting 64 v 48K

Floppy drive B - set drive info and propogate it

Floppy drive B - set parameters at init time


Move buffers into upper part of bank 7 to see if can get kernel below
C000 + E000 upwards to get bigger user image ?

Q for all these machines - if ports in 4000-7FFF range are contended does
it speed up our divide/divmmc code to unroll it and also set b to 0xFF
every 128 so that we never contend

Eventually consider trying to do thunked single process with C000 sized
user but screen mapped and buffers in rest of 7 ?

0-3		Kernel
4-7		User, video in 7

May also be able to later do

0-2		Kernel		3 high kernel common
				7 upper 8K buffers and high stubs
				7 lower screen
4/5/6		User 64K	3 high kernel common , 3 low user

4/5/6		User 48K	7 screen, upper 8K buffers


0/4 hold page0 copies, 3 7 both hold pageh copies - fine as video is
in bottom of that chunk.

Would give direct mapped video

Parent first fork mode
