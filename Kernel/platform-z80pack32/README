Z80 Pack Test For 32K  + cached high for bigger binaries

Kernel
0000-07FFF	CODE1, CODE2
0x8000-0xBFFF	User cache area   (0xB000 discard)
0xC000		Udata
0xC300		CONST, CODE3, DATA ...
0xF000		Common

TODO

We waste 16K per high process but its not clear how much of a win it would
be to pack them, and if we can squash stuff better we might go over 48K and
break it.

binman has no idea how to pack such an image, probably better to have a new
tool as binman is getting too unwieldy. Perhaps it's time to have a tool and
crt0.s that simply reads a table of block/offsets to ldir then runs ? 

Also need to pack carefully so we don't overwrite source data. Probably
means we need to start at the end of the image and lddr back down it.

Need to fix the packing/crt0.s before we can test any of this


Disk swap device recommended

Put the kernel at the end of a floppy image from cyl 60
Add the fs in the first 60 cyls (390 blocks)

Put the bootblock in sector 0

dd the kernel image to offset 199680

ie

dd if=fuzix.bin of=drivea.cpm bs=1 seek=199680 conv=notrunc
