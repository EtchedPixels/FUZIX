Fuzix for the 'SmallZ80' from stack180.com

Supported Hardware

SmallZ80
Optional dual serial card/floppy

Unsupported

Floppy interface

Implementation

This platform has 32K banked and 32K fixed, but rather oddly the banked area
is from 0x4000-0xBFFF, with fixed memory above and below. Also it is unusual
in that the fixed area is a separate RAM not taken from banked space.

Memory Layout

Kernel
0000-00FF	Interrupt vectors
0100-3FFF	Kernel data and some code
4000-BFFF	Kernel code only
C000-FFFF	Kernel code, data and common

User
0000-00FF	Interrupt vectors
0100-3FFF	Kernel data and some code
4000-BDFF	User space
BE00-BFFF	User task state save area
C000-FFFF	kernel code, data and common

Oddities

The only timer source and interrupt source is the RTC. Fortunately this can
provide a 64Hz clock.

TODO

Set up vectors once at boot only (they are not switched)



Emulation Notes

Use a 16x16xn disk image
Put the loader on sectors 0-2 of the virtual image
Put the kernel on sectors 3+
Partition it (taking care to keep or restore the low bits of the loader)
Add a file system
Boot
G, Enter
