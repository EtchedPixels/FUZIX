RC2014 8085

Initial support for the 8085 CPU + 16550A UART card + 512/512 RAM/ROM setup
using RC2014

Supported Hardware

	Etched Pixels 80C85/MMU card with CPU and MMU
	512K linear RAM/ROM card (Small computer central SC119, Tom Szolyga,
	Marten Feldtmann, Rotten Snow #68) etc. *NOT* the Z80 banked memory
	card.
	A 16Cx50 based serial adapter at 0xC0
	PPIDE at 0x20

	A clock source. Either the 82C54 card at 0x3C or a TMS9918A with
	interrupt enabled at 0x98/0x99. If you are using the rev3 or earlier
	board not the erratum and use a diode not a jumper for the IRQ

	PPIDE at 0x20

Options
	RC2014 DS1302 card at 0x0C

To Enable
	ACIA at 0xA0			(in progress)
	Joystick at 0x01/0x02
	More serial ports
	TMS9918A as console maybe ? (what to do for keyboard ?)

Unsupported
	Z80 support chip based devices (SIO, CTC, PIO, DMA)
	IDE CF adapter (unreliable especially with higher CPU speed)
	RC2014 Banked 512K RAM/ROM card (seems too slow for 8MHz 8085)
	Hardware that uses the full 16bit I/O address space

	For hardware requiring the standard RC2014 clock it is possible to
	run with an 8MHz Tundra 80C85-8 part and a crystal at double the
	classic speed.


RC2015 8085 Addresses for I/O

At this point:

0x0C		DS1302
0x20-0x23	PPIDE
0x3C-0x3F	82C54
0x70-0x7F	RAM/ROM card banking control
0x98-0x99	TMS9918A
0xA0-0xA7	ACIA (to add)
0xC0-0xC7	16550A UART

The bootloader from the ROM package goes on block 0 (with partition table),
the kernel goes on blocks 1+ with the file system and PC partition tables
as normal.
