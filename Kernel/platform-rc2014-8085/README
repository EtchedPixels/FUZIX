RC2014 8085

Initial support for the 8085 CPU + 16550A UART card + 512/512 RAM/ROM setup
using RC2014

The ACIA can be supported and maybe the SIO (it has a backdoor way to 'reti')
but the CTC needs the hack so really it would be better if someone built an 8254
card for RC2014. With a bit of hacking the TMS9919A video adapter could also
provide a timer.

The RTC is also not yet wired in. It clashes with the 16C550A card so we need
to get SIO or ACIA support on 8085 up to make it useful. We could alternatively
move the RTC as the cards do let you set their address.

Lots to do including building the board now the bits are done and verifying that
we don't hit any funny hardware compatibility issues.

You need to mod the board to use INT6.5 not INT for interrupts.

RC2015 8085 Addresses for I/O

At this point:

0x10-0x17	IDE CF (ghosts 0x90-0x97)
0x70-0x7F	RAM/ROM card banking control
0x80-0x83	SIO		|	ACIA with narrow decode
0x84-0x87	Second SIO	|
0x88-0x8B	CTC
0x98-0x99	TMS9918A

(ACIA with loose decode covers 80-BF!)

0xC0-0xC7	16550A UART



TODO

DONE - Build Ben's 8085 board with classic 7.3728MHz crystal and 8MHz Tundra 8085
DONE - Verify basic behaviour and compatibility with 512K RAM/ROM
HW IS BROKEN - Check on interrupt behaviour (do we always get FF or do we need
	IRQ routing tricks to RST 5.5 ?)
DONE - Test IDE CF compatibility
- Experiment to see if SIO can be made to work with the 8085 providing CLK
- See if M1 hacks and CTC work or if we need another option
