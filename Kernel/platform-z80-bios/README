TODO

DONE -	Fix disk interface to have common stubs that do banking
DONE -	Make termios copy back data, check matches test bios
DONE -	Write the tty allocation/set up code as per rc2014
DONE -	Rewrite the buffer allocation logic to work with the memory map
	as we can't land the bios code before our code/after our data
	(initial version - need to redo a bit for discards)
DONE -	Add interface to say callbacks set
DONE -	Add pieces to call BIOS (jump table)
DONE -	Write fake external buffer wrappers
DONE -	Who should own space allocation between bios and common - do we
	have a bios "malloc" handler ?
-	Attempt to make this boot with a simple hack fuzixbios on say
	sbcv2
DONE -	Set tty defaults from calls
DONE -	lp error reporting
DONE -	Use info to set common base, program size, buffers etc
IP -	How do we do discard areas ? (just need to write extra buf allocator)
-	header file for asm includes (errno codes, baud rates etc)
-	Error code sort out

BIOS Interface Improvements Then Needed
-	Add bios interfaces for keyboard (up/down input notification and
	key mask etc)
-	Make vt hints set tty size info
-	Media change notifier
-	Blkdev changes to allow open hooking and media change
-	soft di/ei
-	interrupt driven parallel ?
-	Floppy driver
-	Disk ioctls and extend param interface
-	Bank to bank copier hook ?

Fixed assumptions to cure

DONE -udata stash location is hardcoded needs to be (xxxx) form option in asm
program top is hard coded but needs to adjust memory needed per program
likewise


Memory map

0000-007F	Vectors
0080-		Kernel (banked)		(can be higher if linked there)
		BIOS (banked)
		--
		Kernel (common)
		BIOS (common)
		workspace if needed


User space
0000-00FF	Vectors etc
0100-BDFF	Application (depends upon common base)
BE00-BFFF	Udata copy
C000+		common
