Fuzix for CoCo3 (512k)

Copyright 2015, Brett M. Gordon, under GPL2.


This port is for running FUZIX on an emulated 512K Ram Color
Computer 3.  This port is based heavily on the platform-6809test and
the two dragon ports by Tormod Volden.  It will not, as yet, work on a
stock 128k CoCo3; No disk swapping is supported, and until then, a
128K version will be unexciting, anyway.


*************************
REQUIREMENTS
*************************

A working DriveWire implementation.
A 512k CoCo3 (emulator only for now)

and for building:

decb from the toolshed project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/toolshed/
lwtools from William Astle: http://lwtools.projects.l-w.ca/
gcc6809: http://toolshed.sourceforge.net/gcc/



*************************
BOOTING
*************************

Booting this Fuzix is accomplished via some flavor of Disk Extended
Color Basic (DECB).  When building Fuzix two disk images are
produced. The first, "Kernel/platform-coco3/fuzix.dsk", is a standard
35 track DECB image.  This RSDOS filesystem contains a small
bootloader, "BOOT.BIN", that does the serious work of loading the
actual kernel, "FUZIX.BIN", into memory.  There is a HDBDOS/YA-DOS
style "AUTOEXEC.BAS" file included to assist in auto-booting FUZIX.

The second disk image produced is
"Standalone/filesystem-src/fuzixfs.dsk".  This is the actual Fuzix
"root" filesystem, containing the usual suspects.

The stock build can be booted by placing "fuzix.dsk" in Drivewire as
disk 0, and "fuzixfs.dsk" as disk 1.  PLEASE TURN OFF "HDBDOS
Translation" on the Drivewire Server. If not using HDBDOS/YA-DOS type
the following at the BASIC prompt:

LOADM"BOOT.BIN":EXEC 'DW1

The boot loader will automatically consider anything after the BASIC
REM comment as a commandline to be sent to the kernel.  In the above
example, "DW1", indicates that DriveWire Drive No. 1 should be mounted
as the root filesystem.


*************************
KEYBOARD
*************************

Some work needs done on the support on the ALT key shifting.  The ALT
key is hard to use with a emulators that work in Windows or X, anyway.

The tilde, "~", character can be produced with <F1>
The pipe, "|", character can be produced with <SHIFT><F1>

Pressing <CTRL><1> will switch to virtual console No. 1.
Pressing <CTRL><2> will switch to virtual console No. 2.

**************************
BUILDING
**************************

# 1. Build the kernel:
make -C Kernel TARGET=coco3

# 2. Build the boot disk:
make -C Kernel/platform-coco3 fuzix.dsk

# 2. Build the libraries
make -C Library tools/syscall_6809
make -C Library/libs -f Makefile.6809 TARGET=coco3

# 3. Build the utils
make -C Applications/util -f Makefile.6809 TARGET=coco3

# 4. Build disk tools
make -C Standalone

# 5. Build boot disk image
cd Standalone/filesystem-src
./build-filesystem -X fuzix.dsk 256 65535



*************************
TO DO
*************************

* Swapping to disk has not been implemented yet, so a standard 512k
upgrade is required.

* IDE Drivers.

* Better and more DriveWire Virtual Serial Ports.

* Fix the underlying Banking layout to better handle UDATA

* Better support of the GIME chip's video modes

* A whole gaggle of things, to numerous to count.


*************************
BUGS
*************************

* Things work better if you compile the userspace utilities (esp. "init")
with standard gcc optimizations.
