An FUZIX target for z80pack.

Z80Pack has a simple 4K fixed common and 60K fixed sized banks. We run FUZIX
with one application per bank and the memory map currently is

Bank 0:

0000-0080	Vectors
0081-0084	Saved CP/M command info
0088		FUZIX kernel start
????		FUZIX kernel end ~= A000
(big kernels go up to E400 or so!)
E800		Discard (blown away by user processes)
End of kernel:	Common >= 0xF000
		uarea
		uarea stack
		interrupt stack
		bank switching code
		user memory access copy
		bank copy buffer because Z80Pack switching is slow
		interrupt vectors and glue
		[Possibly future move the buffers up here to allow for more
		 disk and inode buffer ?]
FFFF		Hard end of kernel room

Bank 1 to Bank n:
0000		Vector copy
0080		free
0100		Application
ECFF		Application end
ED00-EFFF	uarea stash

Disk swap device recommended

Put the kernel at the end of a floppy image from cyl 60
Add the fs in the first 58 cyls (366 blocks)

Put the bootblock in sector 0

dd the kernel image to offset 193024

ie

dd if=fuzix.bin of=drivea.cpm bs=1 seek=193024 conv=notrunc
