Minimal Requirements
--------------------

- 6809 or Z80 processor
- 128K memory for Z80 (the kernel itself wants between 32 and 40K R/O and about
  8-16K R/W depending upon the configuration. For 6809 the kernel compiles
  to about 24K so a single bank 64K machine just about works.
- Some kind of memory banking giving a common area and multiple banks
- A storage device, preferably hard disk or SD card or similar
- A timer interrupt (but you can sort of run single user with just a serial
  / keyboard irq)

In the ideal world
  256K of RAM or more
  An RTC
  16K flexible memory banking

With a bit more work (ie the planning for it is in place but someone needs
to do the work) it should also be possible to run with

- The kernel code banked in ROM in 3 x 16K banks
- Base/limit address space with a common area and ideally two ranges
  (eg Z180)
- 16/32bit processors with either segments, base/limit pairs or just
  vfork() style switching

Porting Fuzix to a new Z80 based machine generally requires the following

- Pick an output device that is easy to drive (serial or video) and write a
  mininal test output driver for it standalone. Serial is usually best if
  you don't have a character mapped console

- Extend that into a suitable boot loader, unless loading from existing
  firmware (see tips below for CP/M booting)

- Select the appropriate model

  CONFIG_SINGLETASK
  - single tasking (no fast swap device, limited memory). Processes are
  run one at a time and the parent is run length compressed into upper
  memory by default. This will provide all your pagemap helpers
  automatically. This can (untested yet) be combined with SWAP_DEV if
  you have a slow swap device to use other than RAM. With a fast swap
  device and single process you can define SWAP_DEV and not define this.

  CONFIG_MULTI
  - multi process in memory at once (multiple non kernel banks)

  SWAP_DEV
  - swap device number if you have a suitable device for swap. This
    is usually best done after it boots ok

- Pick an appropriate platform to clone.

- A lot of standard code is available to make porting easy

 CONFIG_BANK16 selects support for four flexible 16K bank registers. The non
 common kernel & data parts must all fit below 0xC000, common goes higher.

 CONFIG_BANK32 selects support for two flexible 32K bank registers.
 Currently this is a very specialised port and requires a lot of extra work.

 CONFIG_BANK_FIXED selects support for systems where you have a selector for
 all of the lower parts of memory in banks, and a fixed common at the top.
 It can also be used if the banking is more flexible but has annoying
 restrictions like not being able to map banks into other addresses (eg
 MSX1). This is by far the easiest model to bring up and usually the best
 starting point as you can simply .include most of the code needed (follow
 platforms such as MTX512 or z80pack as examples).

 CONFIG_BANK_LINEAR selects a system where memory is managed linearly with
 base/limit pairs or similar and a common. This isn't yet tested but is
 intended for Z180 and similar, and might be handy as a basis for M68K etc

 CONFIG_USERMEM_C tells the kernel to use the standard C helpers for user
 memory copying. Set this initially for new architectures or for 6502/809,
 and define BANK_PROCESS and BANK_KERNEL to switch kernel/user space. Make
 sure you keep the code in common. The Z80 tree has a standard asm version
 that uses your map_process/map_kernel functions.

 CONFIG_VT
 VT_WIDTH, VT_HEIGHT, VT_RIGHT, VT_BOTTOM

 Include a standard virtual terminal core based upon VT52 emulation

 CONFIG_VT_SIMPLE

 Lets you define VT_BASE and it will drive a character mapped display with
 typical layout. You may need to wrap vt calls in page switches according
 to your platform

 CONFIG_FONT8x8, CONFIG_FONT6x8 and CONFIG_FONT_4x6 will include fonts.
 For 4x6 font usage see nc100.s. The fonts are put in a special segment _FONT
 and your crt0.s needs to decide where to place it. If you place it after the
 data then the binman tool will relocate it to the end of the packed commonmem
 so it  can be moved into another segment (eg to be with the video screen data).
 See pcw8256 for an example of this.

- Set the basic system parameters

 TICKSPERSEC	-	clock rate
 PROGBASE	- 	low memory address fo applications (should be 0x100
			to run standard binaries). Some bits of start.c
			still break if this is not 0x0100
 PROGTOP	- 	first byte above main memory, usually the start of
	   		the udata area and common memory. Typically above
			0xF000 but if your system has a fixed upper common
			then this may need to be lower (eg 0xC000)
 BOOT_TTY	-	the device you will use as your 'console' at boot
			time. 513 is the first tty, 514 the second etc

 CMDLINE	-	pointer to a command line passed from the
			loader/firmware. If booting from CP/M (see below) use
			0x88. Optional.

 NUM_DEV_TTY	-	number of tty devices (video consoles/serial)

 TTYDEV		-	device init will use as input/output (usually BOOT_TTY)

 NBUFS		-	number of buffers for disk cache (each a bit of 512
			bytes)

 NMOUNTS	-	number of things that can be mounted at a time


If you have non interrupt driven serial ports then poll them in your IRQ
handler and provide a platform_idle which also polls the ports (makes it
feel much snappier).

Provide a putchar() that writes to your console correctly either via direct
debug code or later via the tty helper. Provide a similar (register
preserving) assembler hook in outchar. That gives you a usable kprintf in C
and outhl/outde/outcharhex/.. series of methods in assembler for debugging.

On a non single user system provide a pagemap_init which loads a list of
page numbers via pagemap_add. The numbers must *not* include a page 0. If
need be bias or xor with 0x80 or something. At boot you should have 2 or 4
pages mapped (depending upon your kernel), one of which (usually the top) is
common. Add all the pages that are not kernel.

In the 16K bank case you then lastly add the common page. This will then be
allocated to init and become the common for the init. That means you must
keep kernel code/data below 0xC000. Right now that is easy enough but once
we add TCP/IP might need banking.

On 32K banking you can't do this so will need to play uarea swapping games
and keep the top bank as a kernel bank. This is much uglier but unlike
UZI180 only needs to swap uareas around on a true task switch.

If your system has a fixed common area with single not flexible banks then
load the bank selections into the table rather than just loading pages

MAX_MAPS is the max number of pages (or banks whatever you have) that you
can have. Set it to the largest you might need and load those present if
your system comes in different memory sizes.

If you are using swap then

SWAPBASE	-	lowest address that will be swapped
SWAPTOP		-	highest address that will be swapped
			(TOP - BASE is usually a round number of blocks
			 so you don't have to do disk gymnastics in the driver)
			Include the uarea in the common bank.

UDATA_BLOCKS	-	special use (set to 0)
UDATA_SWAPSIZE
SWAP_SIZE	-	number of disk blocks needed to hold all the swap
			for one process
MAX_SWAPS	-	largest number of SWAP_SIZE chunks that will be used
			(bounded by disks/process table size/common sense)

Swap requires specific support in the disk device you plan to use for swap.
See for example the TRS80 hard disk driver. Swap on a box using 16K or 32K
banking is complicated so start out without swap or with fixed banks.


Functions to provide: (*) indicates they should be in COMMONMEM

init_early	-	assembler function called right at the start, can be
			NULL

init_hardware	-	called before main and C entry

			Set _ramsize
			Set _procmem
			call _program_vectors with HL = 0
			(will map_kernel and set the RST vectors)
			Enable any timers
			Call _vtinit if you are using VT
			Do *not* enable interrupts

_program_vectors(*) -	Program the vectors

			You can usually just re-use the default but this may
			vary if you have odd commonmem setups

_trap_monitor(*)    -	Return to ROM monitor/debugger or similar. If you
			have none probably just spin.

_trap_reboot(*)	-	Reboot the machine (may be useful to not do so
			during debug)

map_kernel(*)	-	Set the page mappings to those used by the kernel

			Must damage no registers

map_process_always(*)-	Set the page mappings to those of the current
			process. These are held in the 4 bytes UDATA__U_PAGE

map_process(*)	-	If HL is 0 map the kernel, if not map using the 4
			bytes pointed to by HL

map_save(*)	-	Save the current mapping state

map_restore(*)	-	Restore to the saved mapping state

			These two routines will be called with the same
			common mapped in all cases. The state can therefore
			be saved to common memory. (A task switch will
			exit via map_process_always rather than a restore).

outchar(*)	-	Output the character in A to your debug device.
			Affect no other registers


_switchout(*)	-	Switch out a task

			Copy the one from an appropriate kernel type. This
			will hopefully move into the core code soon

_switchin(*)	-	Switch in a task

			Make the task we want to run runnable. If it is no
			disk and we are swapping then swap it in, if there
			is no room in memory swap stuff out

			Scary bits, copy from a suitable example and do not
			debug after midnight.

_dofork(*)	-	Create two instances of the same task

			This varies by platform type and the code is fairly
			scary. Copy a suitable example. This will also
			hopefully end up in the core once it's stabilized.

If you are using vt

_scroll_up	-	Scroll display up one line

			The vt layer will ask for the bottom line clear itself

_scroll_down	-	Scroll display down one line

			The vt layer will ask for the top line clear itself

_plot_char	-	Write a character to the display. Passed arguments
			are y, x and the character

_clear_lines	-	clear the display from line y for n lines

_clear_across	-	clear the current line from y,x for n characters

_cursor_on	-	put the cursor at y,x

_cursor_off	-	remove the cursor


C interfaces
------------

Devices.c

dev_tab is the device table for your platform indicating what is present.
Usually best taken from another platform and hacked up

bool validdev(uint16_t dev)

Check a device is valid. Cut and paste, it just needs to live with the
definition

void device_init(void)

Called early on before init runs so devices can do initialization before
they are opened. May well be blank

Devtty.c

Define a TTYSIZE buffer for each device present
Copy the struct s_queue from another filled in for your devices/buffers.

Provide putchar(c) if it is not already provided by your asm code

void tty_putc(uint8_t minor, char c)

Write a character to the tty minor

int tty_carrier(uint8_t minor)

Return 1 if carrier raised or you are not implementing the carrier interfaces
yet.

void tty_setup(uint8_t minor)

Do any tty set up required. Called on open and when the user changes the
termios parameters for the tty so you can set speed etc.

void platform_interrupt(void)

Called every interrupt in kernel context with the process state saved. You
may not sleep/taskswitch, you need to keep stack use fairly low. Every timer
tick you should call timer_interrupt() and the OS will do its other
housekeepking.

Note: timer_interrupt may switch task and thus common so call it last unless
you are sure you *really* understand what is going on with fork.

If your tty devices are polled then poll them on the IRQ if not then handle
them here. Either way call tty_inproc(minor, c) with the character to queue
it for input. This may call back to your tty_putc.


Main.c

uint8_t *swapout_prepare_uarea(ptptr p)
uint8_t *swapin_prepare_uarea(ptptr p)

Not needed unless you are doing clever things with udata

void platform_idle(void)

Usually you want to either poll the non interrupt driven devices (ttys) or
if they are IRQ driven then execute a halt instruction. In some cases you
may want to enter a processor low power state or drop to the lowest clock
speed.

void do_beep(void)

Provided for the vt driver. Make an irritating noise. The emulation is vt52
so arguably the beep emulation should sound like someone stripping the gears
on a tank while trying to reverse.

void pagemap_init(void)

See notes earlier - add your pages to the pagemap.


Disk Devices

_open(uint8_t minor, uint16_t flag)

is called on opening. Usually it just checks minor is valid but could check
if a disc is loaded etc

_close(uint8_t minor)

is called on close (eg to force a final flush or to unlock)

_read(uint8_t minor, uint8_t rawflag, uint8_t flag)

is called to read blocks. It has three modes

	rawflag = 0

	A normal read to kernel space. Must be supported. Fetch the
	requested 512 byte block

	udata.u_buf->bf_data is the buffer data to load into
	udata.u_buf->bf_blk is the block number

	If your media is 128 or 256 byte sectors you get to read several.

	rawflag = 1 (optional)

	Allows the char equivalent device to be opened for direct copies
	to the userspace. This means the copy itself will need to be run
	from common memory.

	udata.u_count is the number of blocks
	udata.u_base is the address
	udata.u_offset.o_blkno is the starting block

	Data goes to the current user process

	rawflag = 2 (swap device only)

	swapcnt is the number of blocks
	swapbase is the starting address
	swapproc is the process to swap in
	swapblk is the block number to start at

For a simple system you only need to implement rawflag = 0 and error = 1.
rawflag = 2 will only occur if this is your SWAP_DEV. rawflag = 1 support
may become mandatory as it'll be a good way to optimise execve().

In the swap case beware of the following. You may get issued a request to
write/read processes other than the current process. The map_process
function is defined on 16K banked platforms to remap banks 0-2, as 3 is
switched on task switching and holds the common copy, uarea and top of
process. That means that while uput/uget do the right thing for the current
process, it will *not* do so for addresses above 0xC000 of another process
and this may require special handling.

_write(uint8_t minor, uint8_t rawflag, uint8_t flag)

Same arguments, other direction. This means a lot of drivers turn both into
a call to a common transfer method.



A Note On Geometry Mapping
--------------------------

The conventional mapping of block numbers is to start at track 0, side 0,
sector 1 as block 0, and then follow the usual upward pattern. The OS
reserves block 0 as a boot block, and puts the superblock at block 1.

If you have a disc with a loadable kernel on it then put the kernel on the
*end* of the disc. This means you get a smaller file system on the media but
also means you don't to special case 'boot tracks' or waste any of a data
disc.

The limit on blocks is 65536. Be careful of wraps and overflows when mapping
the geometry. With large media you can provide several 'disks' with
different minor numbers and add 65536 blocks to the base depending upon the
minor.

Nothing stops a driver doing partition tables but we don't currently have a
library for it.

BinMan
------

BinMan processes the SDCC final output image from a ROMable format to
something that fits disc loading. It moves the initializers into the
initialized area (so crt0.s doesn't need to) and it then appends the common
memory on the old initializer address and trims the image. It doesn't touch
relocations. On startup crt0.s sorts out any mappings and then copies s__INITIALIZER
into s__COMMONMEM for l__COMMONMEM before zeroing s__DATA for l__DATA

Tips
----
The most important bit of debug initially is usually proving you got from
your loader to crt0, and then tracking bank changes until the bank code
works properly. On an emulated system you can make it print out bank
switches in the emulator - very useful

If you build a FUZIX kernel image so that cmdline is 0x0088 and it starts at
0x0100 then you can run it from unbanked CP/M (banked CP/M may get a bit
odd unless your crt0.s handles it specially).

Hard Cases
==========

Machines with low banks and a single fixed common
-------------------------------------------------
This needs mucking around copying the udata area back and forth between the
system and a cached copy (much as is needed on 32K banking). Take a look at
the z80pack virtual platform and port to see how to do this. You can
probably simply import z80pack and adjust the drivers. Note that z80pack
supports multiple bank/fixed divides and numbers of banks, so you can bring
z80pack up with your platform configuration

You may have to decide between limited process size or being prepared to do
copying tricks to copy big chunks of memory around. 

If you have only a single user bank however it's easy - see z80pack-lite 8)

Inflexible banking
------------------
Systems where some banks can only fit at some locations. In this case copy
bank16k or bank32 as appropriate but update your swapper logic to find the
owner of a page in the ranges you need and victimise them, or if they are
not usefully flexible then set up fixed sets of them as "banks" and use the
fixed bank model.

The pagemap_alloc/realloc and friends will also need updating - perhaps with
2 or more map tables.

The other examples are things like the Microbee (one 32K bank is flexible
the other is very rigid), and things like the Sinclair Spectrum/Amstrad CPC
boxes.

Research Problems
-----------------
In theory the kernel could be built as 2 or 3 16K banks of pure code, plus data
and some overspill in RAM. This might be very useful for Amstrad CPC type
boxes or the Sinclair Spectrum 128+/+2/+3 type boxes with awkward mapping
limits. Sadly sdcc isn't yet good enough to do this for you.

Swapping Hints
--------------

Your swap device does not need to be a disk. If you have a really demented
memory map and page limits it may actually make sense to treat all the near
unusable memory as swap, especially in singletasking mode. In fact in
singletasking mode your swap acts as a stack. Likewise if your system has
lots of RAM accessible through a small window you can treat it as "swap"
rather than process memory

If you have a "swap" which is actually inconveniently banked memory (eg with
a small window) or memory accessed via a fast I/O interface using things
like inir/otir you have two choices. You could make it a real device so you
can also put filesystems on it, or you could hardcode its use into switchin
and switchout as part of the process task switch. This latter approach is
usually slightly faster and means you can combine fast RAM based flipping
with a real disk swap device.


Known Performance Problems
--------------------------

execve pulls all pages into kernel maps and then copies them to the task.
Fixing this is non trivial but may happen. If so then raw = 1 support for
all disks will become mandatory.

fork is generally used as fork/execve. This causes a copy which is somewhat
surplus but is very bad on singletasking as it is both slow (the compressor
wants rewriting in Z80 someone) and also may prevent the child task fitting.
BSD unix implemented vfork() some systems implemented forkexecve(). We
should probably support vfork().

Other Processors
----------------

Currently only Z80 is properly supported. Clones should also work as should
FPGA cores like T80. The current build uses no undocumented instructions in
any core code.

The 6809 port builds a kernel that has been tested to the point of mounting
the root file system but no userspace work has been done at this point.

Z180 is not yet supported. This requires a rather unique memory banking
module to be debugged plus some driver pieces. It should however then enable
systems like N8VEM Mark IV and maybe even the 'Super TRS80' hacked hardware.

It ought to be possible to port UZI to any other small processor with
banking. That would include banked 6809/6309 systems and perhaps 65C816
(Apple IIGS anyone ?) with a suitable compiler. The current core code has
been test built purely to verify it seems ok on 6809 (gcc) and 6502 (cc65).
Various endianisms in the core code have been fixed but there may be more.

The constraints roughly speaking for any port are

- banked memory
- near full 16bit address space
- some way to do udata. (or take the hit of making it a macro pointer)
- an ANSI C compiler
- timer interrupt, and preferably tty I/O interrupts
- blocking disk I/O. Fundamental to the size and design of the UZI core is
  the assumption that accessing user space and block I/O do not block and
  reschedule
- uniprocessor (well OK there are ways and means to do more but it won't be
  too happy above a couple I suspect)

Without banked memory but with a large address space you would need vfork()
and relocatable binaries. Doable as AmigaOS showed but forget swapping.

As far as I can tell we have suitable open toolchains for

6809 (gcc fork) - although 6809 is well served by NitrOS/9. The core code
has been built with gcc 6809 as a minimal sanity test.

68HC11/2 (for the variants with banked RAM)

TI990 (gcc development) - http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/tigccinst.html
(TI 99/4A anyone ;-))

8086 is a gap but I'm working on pcc 8086 targets and could do with help
there (http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/). Once the compiler is done the port should
be easy and cover both XT and 286.

6502 is probably a cause too far (but prove me wrong...). The core code will
build with cc65.

658C16 seems to lack a serious open compiler although there is a tcc port !
(snes-sdk)

The ANSI ACK can build rather decent 8080 code. Whether the output would fit
in 64K and anyone ever built a banked 8080 who knows 8)

Various other early minicomputers probably also fit the target.

Going to early 32bit CPU is hard because
- not all of the core code is 32bit clean (I've tried to begin marking out
  the argument parameters and the like to fix it)
- the fs code knows that you can't write a size bigger than the filesystem
  so other sanity checks would need adding

A 2BSD/RetroBSD port might make a lot more sense anyway on such a system


Other Things That Would Help
----------------------------

Teaching SDCC to generate better code. It's not bad but sometimes it makes a
right mess, especially of long types. Someone also needs to write the
longlongs signed mod function and fix the fact that discarding the output
of a longlong call currently blows up sdcc.

SDCC call by register

A tool to take all the compiler asm output of FUZIX on Z80, identify common
code blocks containing only internal references (jump/call) and (considering
segments) turn chunks of them into calls (sort of an executable compress).
O88 could do this for 8086. If we can shave a few K off this way it would
be brilliant
