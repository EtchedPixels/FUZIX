/*
 *	We treat the 65c816 as a glorified 6502.
 *	Processes are executed in 65c816 mode with their own 64K bank set by
 *	the bank registers. The CPU stack is 256 bytes in low 64K, and the
 *	direct page likewise.
 *
 *	Because cc65 stores temporaries and return addresses on the CPU stack,
 *	and uses ZP for register variables (whom in C you cannot take the
 *	address of) this works fine for CC65 apps and the kernel likewise only
 *	has to worry about 16bit pointers except for user copies and asm bits.
