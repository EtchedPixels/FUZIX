Puzzles generated using SokEvo
author:Lee J Haywood
website:http://fruise.googlepages.com/home.html
Collection: SokEvo

These designs may be freely distributed and may be used commercially provided
they remain unchanged and I am credited with my name - Lee J Haywood.  Any
similarity to anyone else's work is entirely coincidental and unintentional.

This collection of Sokoban puzzle designs was generated by a program written by
Lee J Haywood that used random numbers and a solving program to 'evolve' them.
