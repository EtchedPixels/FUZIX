# this was based somewhat on the "ar" script from gcc6809

# This script is a frontend to the lwar library manager, to make it
# look more like GNU ar.  Not all ar features are supported here.
# It basically translates ar style options into lwar format.

# Parse and translate command-line options

# ar options cheatsheet:
# r: insert (with replace)
# c: create archive
# u: only replace newer files
# v: verbose mode
# x: extract files from archive
