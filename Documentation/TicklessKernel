Tickless Kernel Support

This document describes how to configure a kernel for a system which has no
available timer tick. Such systems can be made to function but will not be
able to provide particularly fair time sharing or deal with a process spinning
in user space very well.

A clock reference is required and interrupt driven I/O is recommended.

To configure such a system

#define CONFIG_NO_CLOCK

Provide a function

void sync_clock(void)
{
	static uint8_t depth;
	irqflags_t irq = di();
	if (!depth++) {
		Read Timer
		Call timer_interrupt the correct number of times to
			advance
		Poll any non interrupt devices like serial
		depth--;
	}
	irqrestore(irq);
}

Also provide a function

void update_sync_clock(void)
{
}

This is called with interrupts off when the kernel changes its time base. If
you are using the kernel ticks as a timebase for sync_clock you can adjust
your own timing here. If you are doing your timing entirely via internal
variables this function can probably be empty.

Finally ensure your platform_idle routine calls sync_clock(). This ensures
that when idle the time progresses as expected, events happen, sleeps wake and
alarms go off.

Functional Limitations

The timing values for process time used will be rather more inaccurate.

Uptime will be pretty meaningless for CPU load.

Task switching will only occur when a process makes a system call after
exceeding its time quantum, when it sleeps, on process exit, or when a
signal is delivered. The last one is done to ensure that actions such as
hitting ^C have a reasonable chance of working correctly even when a process
is stuck in userspace.

If you have an RTC and your RTC is fast to access you can also consider calling
sync_clock() on keyboard interrupts. That will normally allow an interactive
user to regain control of the system in all cases. If the RTC is slow (for
example a bitbanged SPI) then it is likely to be too expensive to do so.

On some systems it's relatively easy to retrofit a periodic interrupt handler.
A spare serial port can be used as a timing generator, or an interrupt driven
serial port with control lines and interrupts for them (eg a 16x50) can have
one of the control signals wired to something like a PIC generating a 10Hz
square wave, without interfering with the other use of the port.

Such an approach is preferable.
